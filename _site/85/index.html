   <p>Thoughts are ephemeral, they evaporate in the moment they occur, unless they are given action and material form. Wishes and intentions, the same. Meaningless, unless they impel you to one choice or another, some deed or course of action, however insignificant. Thoughts that lead to action can be dangerous. Thoughts that do not, mean less than nothing.</p>

And I wonder, isn’t there some kind of conflict of interest here?</p>

<p>She found two cavities and said, “Well, you’ve done all you could, but sometimes they just happen.” She tried to sound sad, but SHE TOTALLY WASN”T.</p>
