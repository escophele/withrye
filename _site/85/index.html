  <p>“Thoughts are ephemeral, they evaporate in the moment they occur, unless they are given action and material form. Wishes and intentions, the same. Meaningless, unless they impel you to one choice or another, some deed or course of action, however insignificant. Thoughts that lead to action can be dangerous. Thoughts that do not, mean less than nothing.”</p>

<p>— <i>Ancillary Justice</i></p>

<p>That’s what I’ve been saying! I’m all about this and adopt this notion fully. Thoughts without action may as well be no thoughts at all. Be a person of mindful action!</p>

<p>When I was at the dentist a few weeks ago, I thought, as I was opening wide and trying not to look into my dentist’s eyes while she worked, dentists are agents of chaos. They benefit from the inevitable decay of the human body. In the end, if it really comes down to it, they stand on the other side of the line of entropy. And I wonder, isn’t there some kind of conflict of interest here?</p>

<p>She found two cavities and said, “Well, you’ve done all you could, but sometimes they just happen.” She tried to sound sad, but SHE TOTALLY WASN”T.</p>
