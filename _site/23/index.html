  <p>So I’m pretty sick, the sickest I’ve been for a long time. I thought a good night’s rest would cure me, like normal times before, but this bout of <i>disease</i> lingered through the night and totally disabled me in the morning. I was kind of scared for an instant that this might not be in the realm of ailments Walgreens would have a fix for. Then I felt better, and I’ve been drinking strong tea and reading Couch by Benjamin Parzybok. Soup too. My hoodie up.</p>

<p>I am not sure what I have, not really a fever or cold or flu…just a sort of nausea and need to lie down. I tried Nyquil but other than putting me to sleep, don’t really think it helped.</p>

<p>The blurry picture there is from Fort Point, where the barracks are. The doorways go on and on and it was really arresting when I first saw it. I was going to put up one with me in it, at the end of the tunnel, but the lighting was somehow wrong and it was like I was stuck in layers and layers of darkness. Ominous for a post about sickness!</p>

<p>An appropriate quote:</p>
