   <p><span id="dropcap">H</span>ere’s what I did today and what I thought about.</p>

<p>I didn’t remember waking up—just like how I can’t ever know when I fall asleep, oooh, incepted!—but I did remember doing my reflexive day-of-the-week check. What day is it? Is it a weekday??? Oh, it’s Sunday, awesome, relief, back to sleep.</p>

<p>I had dim sum with my grandmother at our usual tea house on Noriega. Because we’ve been there so many times, I can really tell how much the quality varies. Today was one of the better days; the lotus leaf-wrapped rice was nicely seasoned. My grandmother usually talks about the old country and dim sum prices at other restaurants and how little I’m eating. I would reply in bad Chinese and eat some more and my mind wanders a lot.</p>

<p>How do dolphins sleep and not drown?</p>

<p>Gordon called a little after noon after lindy in the park. I was supposed to buy a boxspring with my parents, but didn’t know where they were at that moment so had nothing substantial to relay to Gordon about my afternoon plans.</p>

<p>DSL is not available at my apartment, wtf! With a heavy heart, I ordered Comcast. $19.99 a month for six months, then $40.95 after that. Plus modem. Plus taxes. Fees. And 7% of my incorporeal soul.</p>

<p>Then I ran. I haven’t jogged for a few weeks and was glad to take advantage of the late-breaking sunshine. It felt really good. My favorite route cuts through the middle of Lake Merced. There’s a bridge there once you get inside the golf course, with a water fountain to boot.</p>

<p>As I walked home swigging some sugar-free Red Bull with a new stick of deodorant in my back pocket, I thought I caught a glimpse of a coworker. We made eye contact for a split second and I was passed. It was totally her, I concluded. I wondered if she recognized me with my Aplia cap and can of soda over my face in half swig.</p>

<p>I bet!</p>
