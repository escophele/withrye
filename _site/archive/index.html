         <p>Here’s how you get detached. You have some expectation of what’s going to happen. Then it doesn’t happen like you expected. Maybe moreover, what actually happens is the exact opposite of what you anticipated, which is super jarring. Then this happens again, where you have an initial expectation and then the complete opposite happens. By the third time, you start hedging yourself and think, hmm, whatever I’m feeling now, there’s a chance—and not that unlikely of a chance either since it’s happened twice already—that I’m just totally wrong about what’s going to happen so I shouldn’t go 100% in with this feeling. Maybe 95% in. That natural certainty then just goes down from there, until one day, it’s 0, and any suspicion or intuition or gut feeling, any little tinge you feel about what is going to happen is given almost no weight and then there’s no hope anymore. No excitement. And past a certain point, no fear either.</p>

<p>I like the Penny Arcade podcast a lot. It’s two people, who know each other really well, just talking. The knowing each other really well part is very important. It means you don’t get the filler talk of two socially conscientious people having a nice conversation for an audience. No, you get two people saying what they mean and what they want and going fast and far because they know the other person can keep up. The podcasts start immediately too; there’s no intro music (you get music at the end—they’re not rude), no ads, no lead-in. You hit play and they start talking. It just feels so good to get that, because it’s so rare. It’s pure content without packaging. I don’t want packaging anymore. Just give it to me!</p>

<p>Spring is the worst.</p>

         <p>Volunteering and taking classes at CCSF will save my life! I think. Meetups haven’t turned out that great. When I go to them, there doesn’t seem to be a point. People kind of mill around and look like they expected something more. Volunteering and classes though, those should be purposeful right?</p>

<p>I figured out recently that AT&amp;T blacklists my host and blocks every website on it. That’s pretty bad. I thought it was something wrong with my phone for a while, when I couldn’t access it on data and only on wifi. I put it on a list of stuff to do later and never got back to it until one day Elbert said my site was down, and I was like, hmm, I should really look this up. So I need to move this thing yo.</p>

<p>The Grand Budapest Hotel is so great. Moonrise Kingdom was super awesome too. I’m now a complete Wes Anderson fan.</p>

         <p>I think I’m regressing. It’s been pretty downward sloping the past few years. Becoming more read-only. Pass-through. Things peaked around 2011 I think (in recent history, I mean, not to be all dramatic or anything). That was when I had my studio, a really low-stress job, could bike to work, had game night, people hadn’t moved away yet, and bunch of other stuff I didn’t appreciate as much as I should have at the time. I take that back. I think I did know how great things were as they were happening. I couldn’t stand the thought of stagnation though, and so changed things for the sake of changing things.</p>

<p>As nostalgic as that sounds, I don’t regret my choices, even if they led to worse things. Good, bad, it’s all just experience (which is good!). I try hard not to look back so much, but you know. Overall, I think my twenties were pretty great, even with this :( at the end.</p>

<p>Twenties &gt; college &gt; elementary school &gt; high school &gt; middle school</p>

<p>I’ll be happy if my thirties turn out as good as elementary school lol.</p>

<p>—I feel like I’m on the cusp of something.</p>

         <p>Thoughts are ephemeral, they evaporate in the moment they occur, unless they are given action and material form. Wishes and intentions, the same. Meaningless, unless they impel you to one choice or another, some deed or course of action, however insignificant. Thoughts that lead to action can be dangerous. Thoughts that do not, mean less than nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; text-align:right">&mdash; <i>Ancillary Justice</i></p>

<p>That’s what I’ve been saying! I’m all about this and adopt this notion fully. Thoughts without action may as well be no thoughts at all. Be a person of mindful action!</p>

<p>When I was at the dentist a few weeks ago, I thought, as I was opening wide and trying not to look into my dentist’s eyes while she worked, dentists are agents of chaos. They benefit from the inevitable decay of the human body. In the end, if it really comes down to it, they stand on the other side of the line of entropy. And I wonder, isn’t there some kind of conflict of interest here?</p>

<p>She found two cavities and said, “Well, you’ve done all you could, but sometimes they just happen.” She tried to sound sad, but SHE TOTALLY WASN”T.</p>

         <p>I was getting my noodles after work one time and this couple walked in ahead of me. The guy said, “Oh, that bitch is right there.” He was talking about the waitress that I liked. I pretended to be reading the take-out menu while they approached the counter.</p>

<p>“We’re back! Like we said we would. Here.” He took some bills and coins out. The waitress forced a smile and rang them up like a normal transaction.</p>

<p>“And here’s your ID,” she said. She took it out from somewhere below the counter and gave it to them. I didn’t see, but it would have been awesome if she had originally taken both the scumbags’ IDs.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a homeless lady on my street. I see her every morning. She would stand in front of her shopping cart, and shake out her clothes. She sleeps in the recessed doorway of an empty restaurant space. Well, half of the doorway. The other side was the door to a live restaurant, so she kept that clear.</p>

<p>I would always cross to the other side of the street to avoid her. Before, when I used to walk down her side, she would look at me when I get close and then yell something as I walk past. I never understood what she said.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">&mdash;</p>

<p>I got a free drink at Tpumps the other day because I go there so often and they recognized me. It’s what I really wanted to avoid. I’m not even part of the rewards program. They recognize me at the Indian place too, and at the noodle place. It makes me uncomfortable, as I said before. I know it’s all supposed to be friendly and what the community is all about, and I smile and acknowledge, but I just want my services and transactions to be strictly professional, from perfect strangers. It would be awesome if I did have great relationships with my local neighborhood vendors, but in this weird in-between state, the semblance of familiarity is annoying. It’s headed toward small-talk territory when all I want is my boba and then GTFO.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the guy from Peasant Pie recognizes me too. He likes my shoes. I would not say no to a free pie.</p>

         <p>We watched the hot dog floating in the pool. The bun was sogging up pretty quickly and I wondered if it would drag the whole thing down or just separate from the meat. Or everything might stay afloat despite taking in water. I watched intently.</p>

<p>The caterer, Stu, who was taking a break next to me, watched the hot dog too, but he scowled. Chances were, he was the one who put that together this morning. Pulling open the bun, putting in the hot dog, squirting some mustard—menial, but at least it helped humankind in its own way. Now this.</p>

<p>“That fat kid!” His mustache trembled. “She has a hot dog in her mouth already, and another in her other hand. Why did she try to take another one?”</p>

<p>The kid was crying, her finger out, pointing at the hot dog. Still buoyant, I’d like to report. Bits of bread and meat dropped out of her open mouth every time she took a breath between wails. It was a sad sight, and kind of gross.</p>

<p>“It seems she really likes them,” I said. “Compliments to the chef.”</p>

<p>Stu scowled some more.</p>

<p>The kid’s father came running up and stooped, trying to calm her down. She kept shaking her head and pointed firmly at the hot dog in the pool. The hot dog, in the meanwhile, was drifting slowly away from the edge. Past arm’s length at this point. The father gauged the distance, and to his credit, didn’t try to reach for it. He got up and looked around.</p>

<p>I silently cheered. I was rooting for the hot dog. The bun, thoroughly wet, was still attached, and the team was intact and making a run for it. Stuff like this gladdened my heart.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, this was the most—the <i>only</i>—interesting thing to happen so far. The ceremony had taken forever. The reception was better, but only in that I gained freedom of movement.</p>

<p>The father returned triumphantly with one of those pool rakes with a long pole. The kid had simmered down to hiccups, and had started eating the second hot dog. He eased the rake over the water, back foot planted behind him, hips square.</p>

<p>Then a bark and someone’s dog raced out and leapt into the water. I cried out with everyone else around the pool. The father dropped the pole in surprise. The dog closed in, lunged, and snapped up the hot dog in its jaws. It tossed its head back a few times and the hot dog was gone, bun and all. The dog splashed happily back toward shore. I clapped Stu on the back.</p>

         <p>Luxury of meaning, I’m just trying to survive.</p>

<p>It’s not the bad things. It’s the long knowing that the bad things won’t stop coming.</p>

<p>Speak for me.</p>

<p>There’s this bit from a Jimmy Eat World song I like. Take it all back, take the first, the last, the only. Take it all back, take it all back, everything you showed me. This must be how it feels.</p>

<p>Wait, why can’t she go swimming?</p>

<p>If you run a lot, you likely dismiss the first burst of euphoria. It’s fleeting and does nothing but signal the oncoming pain. But what if the pain never comes, and you run and run, sweetly forever?</p>

<p>The suit ran by me and out the door to the car. Chasing right behind, the blond yelled. Over screeching tires came the parting words, “Business is business, bitch!”</p>

<p>More and more, I distrust people of a sort who like to talk a lot. You can tell they really like hearing the sound of their own voice. It’s like the guy from the Freakonomics podcast. He’s practically like, tonguing himself the entire time. It comes up a lot during meetings at work too, particular when the higher ups get going. Everyone has to sit there and listen to the buzz. I used to just tune them out, but lately, it makes me angry.</p>

<p>Nice people rock because it’s hard to be nice. Not only do they have to be nice, they also have to put up with shit other people give nice people about them finishing last and being pushovers and all that. Go nice people!</p>

<p>The only weapon left is indifference. They can’t win if you don’t care.</p>

         <p>Chase sent me a summary of everything I charged last year. I had spent $11,197.79. That’s not including random ATM withdrawals, so let me round that up to $12,000. $1,000 a month. I don’t have much context if that’s a lot or not compared to other people. Someone told me they usually spend $1,500. Someone else was flabbergasted at the $1,000 number and said they were nowhere close to that.</p>

<p>If I kind of look at it, on its own, $1,000 is a big number. One thousand! Even with a complete record of my expenses on hand, I still don’t really have a fine sense of what I buy over the month. I know food is a big portion. The biggest, I have no doubt. And I thought food was supposed to be a small percentage of expenses in developed countries??</p>

<p>The summary isn’t that much use to me, as I imagine it’s supposed to open people’s eyes on how much they’re spending and motivate them to save more. Me, I realized a while ago my spending habits aren’t going to change, barring something dramatic like marriage or a kid or getting fired; this is pretty much the baseline basket of goods and services I’ve settled on. I don’t feel guilty or lacking, and I think I can sustain $1,000 a month.</p>

<p>I had the worst day at work the other day. I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through. The thing I was working on was already late when I got the final designs for it, so I was working as fast as I could so it wouldn’t be even <i>more</i> late. The time pressure was intense. I got all tunnel-visioned and panicky. It’s the exact feeling I got when I took tests in school and time was running out; that’s something I had hoped I had left behind and would never feel again. Wrong. It was as skin-prickly and short-breathed as ever.</p>

<p>In the end, I managed to put something together, not anywhere near good but good <i>enough</i> and then I died.</p>

<p>Connie said everything was negotiable, and I really need to remember that.</p>

         <p>I would title this chapter in my life “Marketing.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&mdash;</p>

<p>I’ve kept a blog for over a decade now. My first one went up some time in high school, when I found out I can put things on the internet. I really liked that design too—my favorite, in fact. It was very hacky and I did everything I could to get it to look like what I wanted, hell with web standards. It had frames everywhere and I colored the scroll bars and messed with the borders around a pop-up window. It only worked for a very specific version of IE and I think only for about five minutes before scrolling around broke everything. But, it was everything I wanted, exactly as I wanted. I lost it though when Tripod deleted my site. They found out I had circumvented the ads they inserted by leaving a comment tag open at the end of my file. The web was so innocent.</p>

<p>I think I can keep blogging, <i>forever</i>. It’s successfully become a habit and self-sustaining. I do it leisurely without feeling like it’s work or anything. Therapeutic. There’s no update schedule, no comments, no dates—none of that’s coincidental! Whenever it is I decide to update, I also get to go through my pictures, pick one, and put it up. It’s like I’m framing it.</p>

<p>I told Helen about my site and she was like hey you should market it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&mdash;</p>

<p>I made websites as a hobby, and it turned into a job when I graduated. It’s funny how that kind of thing happens. I don’t have a proper CS education or big interest in programming, really, so I won’t ever be a real developer. I attribute the half-ass nature of this situation to why, for all the web jobs I’ve had, I kept ending up in the marketing department. I am definitely not what you would call a marketing person. I mean, that’s like only one step away from <i>sales</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&mdash;</p>

<p>I wish in general I could better articulate what I mean, stick with it instead of rushing or giving up on the explanation because I think the other person’s getting bored.</p>

<p>So there are two parts. First, a person needs to have <i>stuff</i>, right. Content. Cultivate and build up so you have something that’s worthy, some substance, something <i>there</i>. Then, once you have your shit together, you tell people about it. It doesn’t work if you just talk with nothing behind it. And worse, much much worse, if you have something, and don’t tell people.</p>

      <div class="post">        
         <p>They say there will be a big storm tomorrow and they’re closing schools and everything. I am <i>so</i> skeptical it would be anything, really. Like the protests recently, and fucking Occupy back then, so hyped, change is coming, but there’s nothing <i>there</i>, maybe there was something in the beginning, the swell of new purpose—the tents come down all the same. This build-up is so familiar to me now that I side by default with the underwhelm. I keep thinking people are doing things just because they’re bored. It’s like someone who makes it a point to own very few possessions so they can drop everything and leave on a moment’s notice; they think their life would be more interesting than it actually is.</p>

<p>Ha, so I’m saying modern life is so boring that it can even suck the potency out of storms. Anyway, I personally hope it would rain like h*ck tomorrow. I like the complex lighting of rainy days. It makes for interesting pictures.</p>

<p>I got my Strip Search Season 1 DVDs and they are so satisfying. They reassure me that art is worth pursuing.</p>

<p>I’m going to work from home tomorrow, because of the storm apocalypse. It’ll be the first time I do such a thing. When I heard I can work from home, I thought, how great!, the company is so mindful of work-life balance. But it’s actually the direct opposite. WFH implies there’s no separation anymore between work and home, and all my space and time are now available for labor. It’s sick. I think I have to go to meetings through Hangouts.</p>

         <p>Want to put this up. It’s Yosemite Valley, and it just takes your breath.</p>

<p>I just learned that ginkgo trees, unlike other trees that shed their leaves gradually, drop all theirs all at once. The leaves lose color but remain on the tree, and then, at some spontaneous, indeterminate moment, they all fall together.</p>

<p>I mean, what do they hear?</p>

<p>I was talking to Andy, and he told me that he had started driving for Uber and Lyft. I was like, wow, what is that like? Has any crazy stuff happened to you? He said he’s only been driving for a few days, but this one time, he picked up three girls, and they asked if he liked rap. He was like, yeah, sure. So one girl hooked up her phone and turned up the volume all the way. So they were blasting along the highway and the girl in front started <i>twerking</i> next to him. Twerk? I’m not familiar. He said, she was basically grinding her butt against my face while I was driving. I was like lol. He dropped them off and they asked if he would pick them up after? Later, he did pick them up, but then he kind of refused to tell me what happened after that and said that he went home at 10 a.m. the next morning. I was like, what! Tell me! But he was like, no, I kind of don’t remember. And I was like, BS. He said that no sex took place in his Uber car.</p>

         <p>My morning self is the worst me. I get up, and instantly my mind scans for something to dread for that day and latches onto it. That bad thought, being the first thing, is potent, like a morsel on an empty stomach. The light hurts.</p>

<p>My midnight self is the best me. Lying in bed, everything seems so possible and easy. I would go over my awesome plans and all paths are clear. I can’t wait for the morning to come.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten so bored of these moods—they are clockwork, and happen regardless, and super useless. Now, I try to pay attention only to feelings I’ve earned and cultivated. You can’t control your feelings, I still think this, but you can be discerning and trace back where they come from, and, even if you can’t do anything about them when they kick in, know which ones matter and which ones are just random-ass chemical reactions with no basis.</p>

         <p>Chris once said that he doesn’t chew gum because it’s so useless. That really cracks me up, so good.</p>

<p>When I can’t sleep, I sometimes imagine all the places where I’ve slept before, visualizing them from my prone body’s perspective, shifting through all the rooms, beds, couches, tents. Even with my lousy memory, I can still remember a lot. I like to think my brain makes sure to get a good memory of the place where I fall asleep so if I wake up suddenly, from a growl of a lion or something, I can get oriented quickly and not run into a tree.</p>

<p>On my list of all-time favorite things to spend time on, doing nothing is pretty high up there. This can explain a lot of laziness. I can’t tell if it’s just because most of the activities I think of or encounter are so lousy that they can’t even beat doing nothing, or if doing nothing is inherently precious and supreme and sets a standard that’s hard to beat.</p>

<p>I quit my job. The last few days there flew by super fast. I didn’t pack my stuff until the last minute and didn’t get a chance to look through my email and old files like I imagined I would. My goodbyes felt rushed and cursory. When I handed over my key card at the door, shook hands, and walked away, it felt so, I don’t know, like the event didn’t really <i>mean it</i> and just half-heartedly happened? It didn’t seem final like quitting something should. Maybe I’m desensitized.</p>

         <p>One time, I drove up the coast to Oregon in December. I went alone. I took the 1 all the way, and it was dark and stormy and awful. I was really afraid I’d hit something or someone or go over a cliff.</p>

<p>I checked into the hotel after midnight. I thought of nothing but sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up slowly. I pulled back the curtains and everything was this really comforting gray. My room was next to a rocky beach; it literally was a step outside my window. I watched the ocean and the choppy waves and a seagull huddling against the wind, and all of this was under fat storm clouds and there was a light rain everywhere.</p>

<p>I remember the moment so vividly. It comes to mind when I think…peace.</p>

<p>I’m about to give up something perfectly good and safe for something new and I’m wracked with doubt. And it’s not like I can go to <i>Oregon</i> every time.</p>

<p>Well, it feels okay, actually, eventually, after I write it out and think through it. It’s a good thing to move on, right. It’s only the first instinct that has the panic and reflexive jolt. I know I’ll wake up to it tomorrow morning and freak out, then gradually level things out when my forebrain warms up. I only wish it didn’t take so long, this gross transition limbo phase; I can’t handle the suspense.</p>

         <p>There is this annoying Muni driver on the N every morning who likes to talk a lot over the PA and call people “folks.” He’s being friendly and whatever, but I can’t stand his voice. The pitch and rhythm and irritating as ass <i>cadence</i> of it. I got it. He sounds like Duffman. It feels so good to put on earphones and drown him out. I literally smile when I can’t make out what he’s saying. I feel the same thrill when there are crazy people raving on the bus. Their lips can keep on smacking, but they have no power here har harhar.</p>

<p>If there is anything I am the complete opposite of, it’s the parking lot of a bar. It’s not a really good way to put it, but that’s what came to mind. It’s not even like hate—though it is hate—my whole body is so repulsed by bar parking lots on a cellular, no, <i>sub-atomic</i> level, that if I somehow do end up in a bar parking lot, me and the parking lot will cancel each other out and there would just be a big crater. Having lived across from one for almost two years, I am on the brink.</p>

<p>Why is it so hard to block out sound? You can close your eyes, and that’s that. You can breathe through your mouth and smell’s gone. You can just not touch stuff, and not lick things. But sound, almost impossible. Does our biology value hearing so much that we can’t turn it off?</p>

<p>The architect walked through what was left of the city, taking precise notes on the wreckage of each lot. People were already emerging from their bunkers and ruffling through the debris for usable belongings. She waited impatiently until they moved on—weary, downcast eyes—before she picked her way to the building’s foundation and inspected what had survived this round.</p>

<p>She cursed. Her new framing designs had done nothing. An entire side of the house had lifted from the foundation. She knelt and peered at the gap. She cursed again. The other side had separated too; she could see all the way through to daylight. She wiped her forehead and jotted down another angry mark.</p>

<p>At least there were still walls. On her first audit, there was nothing left. Just a scattering of foundation stones surrounding the bunker hatches.</p>

<p>Progress, the architect told herself as she crossed the street to the next block of destroyed houses, carefully treading her way around the broken pavement and loose dirt that fringed the deep gashes on the road.</p>

<p>Then she heard whistling. A bright, playful tune. On the other side of the road, standing on a mound of dirt, was a tall figure with a shovel. The shovel dug into the mound, lifted, and flung dirt into the hole in rhythm to the song. There was a bounce to the person’s movements that clashed harshly against the ruined city. The architect seethed.</p>

<p>“Ditch digger!” The architect called out, walking straight toward the dirt mound, unmindful of her footing.</p>

<p>The ditch digger changed her whistle to a high inquisitive note as the architect stormed up. “You talking to me?” she said. She jammed her shovel  into the dirt and leaned against it.</p>

<p>“Yes, you, with the shovel,” the architect said.</p>

<p>“I’m no ditch digger. I fill ditches. Ditch filler,” the ditch filler said proudly, poking a thumb to her own chest.</p>

<p>“Same difference,” the architect said, annoyed. “I want to know, how can you whistle at a time like this? Rubble surrounds you!”</p>

<p>The ditch filler thought for a moment, then shrugged. “There are lots of holes,” she said, explaining to the poor simple architect. “There will be more tomorrow, I think. And I’m pretty good at filling them, if I do say so myself.” She beamed, and set back to work with her shovel.</p>

<p>The architect fell silent. The sun came out and flared out ahead of her just then, throwing the ditch filler into sharp relief as she swung her shovel, each drop of sweat bright, against the crumbling silhouettes of a fallen city.</p>

         <p>I’m going to talk about money now.</p>

<p>I’m trying to get as much money as I can so I can stop working. Not to accomplish some noble goal. Not to save the world. Not to whatever. What I truly, madly (deeply, even) want is to gain full power over my own time.</p>

<p>I read a post about an early retiree who explained why retirement was so important to him, why it was worth the decades of sacrifice and lean living. It was about getting rid of fear. From the moment we are born, someone else has had the reins over our time. They tell us where we need to be, what we need to do, and we listen and obey because of fear on some level. Even when we become adults and are supposedly free, we have to go to work and do what other people want because we’re afraid we’d be homeless or our kids would starve. (I should use “I” here instead of “we,” but I’m going to venture that being homeless and hungry kids are pretty universal fears.)</p>

<p>Retirement is freedom. That peace knowing no one can threaten your well-being by firing you is liberating.</p>

<p>So, to get to all that, I’ve been bringing lunch to work instead of eating out. It was kind of great, and I felt good about acting so directly to change my fate. Then it got sucky. I hate it. I hate everything about bringing lunch to work. I hate making it every day. I hate having to carry it on the bus. I hate eating the boring things. I hate washing the tupperware afterward. In fact, I hate bringing my own lunch so much that I will give up a year’s worth of retirement so I can eat out for lunch. Fuck it.</p>

         <p>I don’t know what to focus on. Job, writing, or dating. It’s especially hard because I need to do things one at a time to be effective. Each of those three things seems like it’s on a timer and I need to address it right now before it’s too late. Harried.</p>

<p>I live really close to my parents’ house, about two miles, and whenever I have dinner with them, I would walk back, afterward, to my apartment. The walk usually takes forty-five minutes. It goes through this big residential district, block after block of quiet houses on quiet streets. It’s usually just turning dark then, sunset in the Sunset!, and I would pass by windows filled with this warm domestic glow. Cars all parked in their driveways. Drifting out, low chatter of TV, regular chatter, and flutes, pianos, violins squeaking in practice.</p>

<p>And I think, is this what people want? Is this family life, this social standard, the only unassailable pursuit? The only thing that you can most assuredly say really matters, especially in the end? Then I think about how immeasurably far away I am from that glow, both in desire and present status, I might as well be walking through craters on the moon.</p>

         <p>Lately, I’ve been trying to do cumulative things. Things like saving money, running more, meeting people. Adding a little, over time. I won’t be ready for the big events, I guess. Like that Bright Eyes song, right, I’d rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery.</p>

<p>I went up to the lady sitting behind the sign-in sheet and introduced myself. She gave me a look and asked if I had been here before. I said no, it was my first time. She shrugged. I made a mark next to my name and sat down.</p>

<p>The cafe was on a really quiet residential street and it was just as quiet on the inside. Everyone typed on their laptops and sipped from thick mugs. I was there for a writing session, where people sat together and just wrote for an hour or two. It sounded contradictory when I read the event description. I mean, what was the point of doing solitary things together?</p>

<p>There were two other first-timers at my table, and one regular. He was working on a fantasy book too. The first newcomer liked unreliable narrators. I wasn’t sure what the third person was working on, but she had asthma and apologized for coughing so much and reassured us that she wasn’t spreading contagious germs.</p>

<p>It was nice talking with people who wrote. So there it was, the point. I spent three hours there and didn’t feel like I should be anywhere else or be doing anything else.</p>

<p>On the way back, it finally occurred to me why the sign-in lady thought she recognized me from somewhere. We freaking work in the same place. Crazy.</p>

         <p>I joined OKCupid last week—rejoined—I had a really old account from five years ago. I read through that profile, and though I recognized bits of myself, I was <i>so</i> not that person. I deleted everything and started over.</p>

<p>After a week of this, it seems to me that dating sites take the really long way around to get to what people want: to meet someone. Meetups would be the better option. They cut right to the meeting-people part and if you don’t find the love of your life, at least you’re doing something fun, instead of just scrolling down an endless wall of faces night after night.</p>

<p>I am determined though, to get an OKCupid date. It’s going to be so interesting to see.</p>

<p>I asked someone what it’s like to be a girl on OKCupid, if she just gets inundated with messages. She said she doesn’t know how it compares to most other girls, but yeah, a lot of people talk to her. It gets old and annoying after a while with guys telling her she’s pretty or has nice eyes. I said I imagine this place could really get her all jaded. She was like, well, it’s like that in real life too, except online no one is even really looking at her when they say those things.</p>

         <p>When I go into the bathroom at work, while standing at the urinal, I sometimes think, what if I psych myself out and can’t pee and end up just standing there without making a sound. And that eventually I would have to turn around and leave the bathroom <i>without peeing</i> while the guy waiting for the urinal looks at me and knows my failure.</p>

<p>It’s such a relief when I finally do go.</p>

         <p>Sometimes sloths grab their own arms thinking they’re tree branches then fall to their deaths what?</p>

<p>A: Cheer up B. There’s always tomorrow. Life is like opening a brand new wrapped box when you wake up. That’s why it’s called the present! Ha ha!
B: Right, except when you open the box, you find that there’s a great big turd in there.
C: No, it’s even worse. You realize it’s the same thing in the box every time, day after day. Even if it’s the best thing ever the first time, like a brick of gold, by the thousandth time, you would hate it. <i>That’s</i> what life is like.
A: …
B: Hm. So, what if I get a <i>new</i> turd every day? Are you saying that would be better than getting the same gold brick?
C: …</p>

<p>I remember this thing that happened in college. I worked at the school paper, and I got this email one day from someone, forgot who, who CCed almost every staff member. There was going to be a secret meeting that night to discuss ousting the editor-in-chief and we shouldn’t tell anyone about it. Whoa, what? I wanted to get more details, but no one had much.</p>

<p>When I got there that night, the room was full of people agitated and confused, wondering what was going on. Apparently the editor-in-chief was incompetent and played favorites, especially with one of the editors, paying for hotel rooms using the paper’s funds and all sorts of stuff. I had been around for only the summer before, so it was the first time I was hearing all this. The editor-in-chief seemed like a nice person to me. But I was deep in the den of righteous college kids who found a cause, and it was pretty exciting.</p>

<p>The plan was to show up at one of the student association meetings where the university admins talked with the managing staff of the newspaper. There, we would demand that the editor-in-chief step down or we were going to strike. Wow!</p>

<p>People pointed out that that was pretty severe, and no one really wanted to lose their jobs. So the striking thing was downgraded and applied only to the few people who personally felt they couldn’t work with the editor-in-chief anymore, and the rest of us could still show up, without quitting, and offer our support.</p>

<p>One kid objected, saying that he wasn’t going to be part of this sudden thing dropped onto his lap. Where was the proof that the editor-in-chief misbehaved? He wasn’t going to risk his job over this just because everyone else was. One of the organizers of the coup jumped all over him and later, after everything was over, would call him a coward.</p>

<p>I fully support that kid, looking back, it was very brave of him to resist peer pressure, so kudos to him, but at the time, I wasn’t really paying attention because E.H. rose and spoke, saying that the whole point of the newspaper was to give us a chance to learn, and the editor-in-chief was making the environment hostile to that. I swooned.</p>

<p>Later that week, I found my way to the rarely visited offices on the upper floors of the student union. The room was crammed, standing room only, full of kids along the walls surrounding the conference table, where a couple of college officials sat, along with the editor-in-chief, completely stone-faced, pointedly ignoring the few dozen of us all massed around them. The whole situation was so funny and ridiculous. I walked in and looked across the room and caught the eye of E.H., who smiled at me. I found a spot along the wall.</p>

<p>The meeting had an agenda apparently, and our issue was the last item on the list, so we waited while they talked about budgeting and whatever for a few more minutes. And all this time, the newspaper staff just stood there, looming over them. It was great. Then it was our turn finally, and we spoke our grievances and the editor-in-chief stared daggers at all of us. The college officials said they were going to look into it, and dismissed everyone. As I filed out, I thought how super cool that was.</p>

<p>I admit I didn’t really care that much and was just there for the ride (and because of E.H.), but the whole thing felt like some kind of replay performance. Like, we heard and read all about real people standing up for far more serious things in the past, things that actually mattered, not some silly college newspaper drama, but we decided to put on our own version when we found the opportunity. The whole point was for a chance to learn, right.</p>

<p>The editor-in-chief did resign eventually, but by then it was spring and everyone was graduating. Still, we patted ourselves on the back for a job well done and for saving the paper.</p>

         <p>I think people should propose at the worst possible time, like right in the middle of an argument, perhaps, or maybe after you were an hour late to dinner, or had just lost the cat. It certainly helps to get a yes when you’re on a sunset beach, or in the warm glow of an after-dinner fireplace, or running through some starlit meadow. But if they marry you even at your bottom, your crappiest, without props or benefit of presentation, you can be pretty sure they mean it.</p>

<p>This came to mind when I was thinking about all the elaborate proposal videos with dance numbers and Disney characters, and it’s a whole production, and how put on the woman must feel, under all that romantic duress, if she wasn’t sure she wanted to marry the man. Now suddenly she has to deal with all these eager faces pressuring her to say yes. And even if she does say yes, what if she did it only because she happened to really like dance numbers and was caught up in the moment and it’s <i>that</i> that persuaded her? That would suck! Can’t take the dancers home! Better to not fuzz up that threshold and hope to squeak by.</p>

<p>I really liked the proposal videos where she says no on the Jumbotron, which then zooms in on his crushed face as his heart implodes, or the one where she just runs away from all the hired acrobats and stuff and leaves him kneeling on the boardwalk with this whole circus and sad clowns behind him. Hilarious!</p>

         <p>Gloomily, I’ve been thinking how all I’m doing right now is waiting for bad things to happen. Like it’s a setup. Like I’m lalaing in some catastrophe waiting room, if you will, with seats bolted to a slow conveyor belt, sliding toward flames.</p>

<p>That, and paying indefinite dues and scrambling at the lid to stay afloat.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ll ever have things squared away, or be on the heavy side of the balance.</p>

         <p>I scrolled out really far in my work calendar. 2014, 2015, 2016. Only the recurring items were left as I scrolled through the months and years. 2017, 2018. I got hit with this serious pang of something like future nostalgia as I looked at the appointments and meetings flash by, scheduled with coworkers I see every day now who I doubt will still be there in 2019. Even sadder though, is if I’m still going to those same meetings with the same people.</p>

<p>I kept scrolling. Where would I be in 2039? Hopefully alive. That’s twenty-five years from now, almost double the entire time I’ve lived so far. I’ll be past fifty. So crazy. If I do live to be a hundred, that’s forty plus years more. Damn, life is hella long. There’s this whole expanse before me and no guarantees I would fill those days of potential. It’s all laid out though, super possible.</p>

         <p>During the jury selection process, they called twenty-four people to sit up front while the rest of us sat in the audience section, on standby to fill in. I was still pissed having to come in, but as I listened to all the excuses the first batch of people were dishing up, I got disgusted with the weaseling and just resigned myself to the big government D.</p>

<p>There was this one guy, in a suit and haircut, who introduced himself as a technology executive and, answering the judge’s question about prior jury experience, said he was summoned six times and dismissed six times. He suddenly was the most interesting person in the room to me. I stared hard at him the entire time. He spoke curtly, pausing slightly before speaking, as if setting up a tiny verbal stage, and then only saying a few direct words. He had no expression during the whole thing, but he kept clenching and unclenching his robust, shapely jaws, and I watched his jaw muscles bunch and strain.</p>

<p>He was dismissed.</p>

<p>Whenever I walk into a store, thinking I need something, then realize I really actually don’t, and proceed to walk out empty-handed, I always think I look really suspicious, the way I’m heading straight for the door and bypassing the normal route through the checkout stands that decent citizens use. Even though I know it’s silly and they can’t do anything to me, I prepare what I would say if the store staff stops me.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I was at Bottom of the Hill with Helen and Alice. I had only heard of one of the bands on that night, Caspian, from a Neogaf thread I think, and that involved only listening to like two of their songs. I was all in for novelty. They came on second, and their presence alone blew away whatever impression or regard I had for the first band. During one of their songs in the middle, I felt like some jaguar warrior on a warpath and the bass was breathing for me.</p>

Then they bend and you have to see. A step carries with it the next; you have already raised your back foot. So you go, and go straight, because the ground is even and you don’t have to choose left or right. Turning around is now unthinkable. Go back? No.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">A</span>t times, when I talk to people or am just walking around, I would imagine little numbers appearing over their heads as they see me and register an impression. Green +’s if I engage them and come off like a good guy, and red -‘s for every stupid thing I say. These little numbers would pop up above their heads in a steady stream and vary accordingly during our interaction—a lot like that wiggling line of instant feedback during a presidential debate.</p>

<p>I’m writing again, which is good, considering it’s the only thing I can see myself doing long term. I’m not as serious as I should be about it though and it’s getting me down. But I finally finished a whole draft of a short story, beginning to end. It still needs a lot of work, but it’s pinned down on paper, and it’s now mortal. It feels amazing. It can sit and simmer for a while before I edit it. And the best part, I can now at last go back to work on the big book. Taking a break with the short story really rejuvenated my mindset about the novel. I had left it a big steaming mess several months ago, when I couldn’t stand to look at it anymore. I had no idea where I was going or what I was doing. Picking it back up now, I feel oddly calm and cool, like I can work through the tangles one at a time. I tidied up the outline a bit, looked over my process, and things don’t seem crazy unmanageable anymore. I really hope this lasts. There is nothing I want more.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">T</span>he future is a dark blank wall receding before us, one second per second, just tiny inches in front of our nose. It could become whatever we want.</p>

<p>The other day, I lost my keys while out running, and I was like, fuck all. I had run through the park to the beach and was halfway back when I patted my empty, empty pockets. I had no idea how or when they fell out—I would need to backtrack the entire way through the dirt and mud. And it was getting dark.</p>

<p>I had my phone, so there was that. I could call my landlord to let me in, I suppose, but for some reason I completely believed I would find my keys. Like, total certainty. It was a linear issue, I thought as I swept the ground with my phone light. A self-contained problem. The keys, wherever they were, were 100% between my apartment and the waves at the beach, along the way I had come. They couldn’t be anywhere else. It was just a physical matter of me going back and there they would be. It was <i>destiny</i>.</p>

<p>It was fully dark now. I worried about my phone’s battery. I checked the water fountain I stopped at for a drink. I looked at the base of the tree where I stretched. I tried to remember where I had gotten hot and started to take off my hoodie then reconsidered, thinking what a hassle it would be to carry, and so left it on. I was now at the edge of the park. Okay, so my keys weren’t in the park. I crossed the street to the endless possibilities and optimism of the beach. In the dark, the sand looked just impossible. There were the steps up ahead where I shook out of my shoes, my keys must have fallen out there when I sat down. I—</p>

<p>FUCK YES THERE THEY WERE. Lying in the middle of the sand. I had no idea how I saw them. TAKE THAT UNIVERSE!</p>

<p>I clutched my keys in success kid fashion, then tenderly brushed the sand off as I made my way back, enrobed in triumph.</p>

<p>But there’s more! As I was waiting to cross the street, gazing fondly at my precious, a couple next to me said, “Ah, so those are yours.”</p>

<p>I was like, “Yeah!”</p>

<p>“We pulled them out of the sand at first, they were almost buried.”</p>

<p>I thanked them profusely.</p>

<p>In my weird heart, I was disappointed that someone had to intervene to afford me this victory. It would have been so nice to think I found the keys all by myself! But I didn’t make sense. I seemed to be preferring not finding my keys without help to finding them with help? I still don’t know.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">W</span>hen I run out, feel bottom, have nothing be there when I reach out, I say out loud STOP and remind myself—there’s a whole other side I’m forgetting at the dismal frenzy moment. A whole other side of good things, which are so clear and catching in a better light of mood, but, deep down in the tunnels where I get stuck, I cannot see or feel them. So I revisit favorites, summon backup, think fondly. Even if all that doesn’t work, it helps.</p>

<p>The stone road is very, very long. No one knows where it ends. It passes by every known city, goes through the border towns, and leaves behind the last frontier outposts. On and on.</p>

<p>The monks repave the eroded slabs, help travelers, and tend to the milestones and wayside shelters. But most of the time, they walk.</p>

<p>Anyone can join. The monks, though, do not advise one to spend their life walking on a road with no end. But still they come. Many pledge themselves, for every reason in the world, and start walking. Most turn back within a few days. The added insult, of course, is that they have to walk back.</p>

<p>She has been walking for eighty years. She took her first step when she was thirty years old, with nothing left behind her, before her only the rising sun. The last shelter she passed was one she built herself, two decades ago. A decade after that, under a freshly chiseled milestone, she buried her last traveling companion and wept.</p>

<p>She walks now, alone, slowly, her cane taking the longer strides. Her eyes remain as ever on the horizon. The sunrise is beautiful.</p>

<p>Squinting into the light, she sees a figure walking toward her.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">O</span>regon! I spent five days on the road with Chris, Amy, and Hieu-Nam last weekend, looping up California, around Portland, and back down the coast. The trip is just starting to blur in and mix, tinting my life a bit greener.</p>

<p>Everything had that loamy saturation of color, like after a storm. And the TREES. Everywhere everywhere. I will never see as many.</p>

<p>Crater Lake joins the Grand Canyon as places you have to see in person. My body rocked when I first walked up and saw the water. This is what it’s about.</p>

<p>I still got the uneasy small town feeling, every time I go anywhere outside a city. I don’t belong here, I keep thinking. I’m too used to the massive, pervasive indifference from people in cities, the comfort of strangers. There isn’t enough!</p>

<p>Our lighthouse tour guide—it was her last day—gave us more time up near the lamp and told us about the haunted bed-and-breakfast down the road. She was very effective.</p>

<p>We saw the only rain of the trip that day. But magically, a window of sunshine opened up, beginning a little after we arrived at the lighthouse until precisely when the tour ended. The ghost must have favored us and wanted us to be happy.</p>

<p>We were driving through the redwoods slowly, then Icona Pop came on and it was the best thing evar.</p>

<p>I have so many pictures I want to post. It was awesome to find out Amy was into photography too. Between the four of us, we have like 4,000 images lol.</p>

<p>I used to be a lot more thorough with recaps, but I’ve lost the urge to give complete accounts. Now I just output these disjointed paragraphs. I will get those pictures up though. I look forward to doing something with Flickr.</p>

<p>I think I know the source of my travel bug. I’m all transitory and nebulous here, and I don’t feel much gravity. Traveling is transitory and nebulous too, only it’s more <i>interesting</i>. It’s what I noticed after Korea, and more so this time, my increasing homelessness.</p>

<p>I sometimes get really tired after work and go straight to bed, skipping dinner and everything. Without fail, it has turned out awful and I regret doing it. I would wake up like an hour and half later and spend the rest of the night hella awake lying there in bed staring at the ceiling. I might as well have been guzzling down concentrated caffeine sludge that entire time. Goddamn it.</p>

<p>Insomnia makes me so helpless; I can’t <i>will</i> myself to sleep. In fact, <i>trying</i> makes it harder. I have to treat it like some skittish wild deer or something, and not <i>want</i> it to get it. The fuck is this. I can take sleeping pills of course, but I can’t ever tell if they work. I want something that instantly makes me sleep, whenever I want to, like a button. I already hate how much time sleep takes up; to have to spend more time coaxing and playing PUA games with it is just stupid ridiculous. I hate you, biological requirements!!!! I HATE YOU.</p>

<p>I can’t see without my glasses, but in my dreams, I can see perfectly. It’s the first hint I am dreaming, afterward in the morning, when I think about it.</p>

<p>I can see Timmy in the doorway, just standing there. I can’t see his face. There is a strange glow behind him that masks him in shadow. I call out, Timmy, Timmy, but he won’t answer. He seems distracted, moving his head back and forth from me to something else in the room.</p>

         <p>I just came back from a trip to Korea with Victoria and I think I finally get traveling. I have always enjoyed <i>having traveled</i> more than actually <i>traveling</i>, and I have no doubt things would be the same. It’s the denouement, you see—knowing you’ve attained and overcome, with no further action required except to take stock. I love taking stock.</p>

<p>I got a new camera too, and the best part of taking pictures has never been the taking pictures part, but the afterward, when you’ve just finished importing from the SD card and you open the folder to a sea of thumbnails loading in a cascade, literally developing as you scroll down.</p>

<p>Things turned out differently. I remember well the first night when we finally got to the hotel and it was midnight and hungry and Seoul and we trekked out. Walking through those short, amber alleys, I felt then as present and <i>there</i> as I ever had. This came up again and again over the week. Then it was over. I landed at SFO thinking it was unfair. <i>This is bullshit!</i> Why can’t I keep going?</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">B</span>rothers: A Tale of Two Sons has a story that only works as a video game. It’s one of those rare, unadaptable things that can’t survive outside its native medium, like the Catcher in the Rye or the Matrix. The ending of the game hits so hard and so precisely in a way only available through player interaction. A book or a movie cannot capture or express with remotely as much emotional impact that perfect moment the whole game builds up to.</p>

<p>I haven’t played the game, funny thing, but I found out indirectly how potent and inseparable that connection is.</p>

<p>I read reviews and they all heap praises on the ending, that they can’t talk about it, how it brought them to tears, and how I just have to experience it myself. So of course, I went straight to YouTube.</p>

<p>I watched a playthrough and didn’t get it. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I went back a few minutes and thought maybe I missed something earlier. Nope. I jumped to the beginning and looked for any foreshadowing that the ending might be referencing, but still nothing. Hmm, what am I missing.</p>

<p>Then I came across another video, this time with audio commentary from the guy playing it. I listened intently when he gets to the end of the game, and then—oh shit.</p>

<p>This is the thing: you do not get the whole story even if you have all the visual and audio content in front of you—you need to be there with a controller in your hands. That is as critical as what you see and hear on the screen. I can’t get over how amazing this is.</p>

It’s too easy to make that sound cooler than it actually is: it’s for a tooth implant and the rod is only about an inch or so long. But wait again, it actually <i>is</i> pretty awesome. The dentist showed me an x-ray and there was this precise, bright rod floating in the middle of all my face bones. I’m bionic!</p>

<p>I have a ladder of worries. It’s always at the back of my mind. When one worry gets resolved or when I realize how stupid it is and get over it, I go up a higher rung and get all worked up and lose sleep over that.</p>

<p>So this is what I’m worrying about, as of this moment, in ascending order: my titanium rod will get infected and my jaw falls off; I will get fired when I walk in on Monday for something I did on Friday thinking everything was hunky-dory; a car will run me over and I barely survive with immense physical and mental problems and I’ll go bankrupt from the medical bills, so I’ll end up a homeless retarded cripple; and at the very top, my constant worry: my parents dying. I’m not sure why I worry about that the most.</p>

<p>Distilling the facetiousness away from that, it’s health, job, and family. So it seems I wouldn’t find present peace until I win the lottery, become an immortal robot, and my entire family becomes immortal robots.</p>

<p>Or, of course, I could be more accepting of the universe and deal with things as they come, like a responsible mature person, which sounds annoying as fuck. Like a cow with its head down standing against the rain (that line’s from a good book).</p>

<p>You know those midgeflies you hear about that live for like an hour, mating like crazy, and die off once the eggs are laid, so their offsprings can do the same thing?</p>

<p>Those flies distill and make clear the pointlessness of life. For all of human society and civilization and whatever, that’s what our fleshy bodies are telling us to do—every breath we draw, every sense at our disposal, every evolutionary adaption we’ve snatched up, every secretion from some hormonal gland—they aim us toward a propagation chain.</p>

<p>We have outgrown this reason to keep ourselves and our species alive. No one’s living just to have kids. But this is still largely the main life goal for a lot of people. Get married, start a family, raise children. This instinct has the collective weight and momentum of billions of years of life on this planet behind it.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">H</span>appiness comes from not thinking. The easiest way to not think is to be surrounded by friends and family. I think that is a significant portion of the benefit of loved ones: to distract from introspection. There is no happiness within. If you look, you’ll just find bits of useless epiphanies you can’t transfer to your everyday interactions. Like bottled fireflies. This is hard for people who think they are the shit, all their inner thoughts and fascinating revelations. The people they interact with have to be extra special and engaging in order for them to lose themselves in outward attention. In ordinary company, they will find themselves to be the most interesting person in the room, and turn inward. This becomes a pattern, and they will eventually stop meeting people, and remove all chances of meeting those extra interesting people who can save them from themselves. There is hope though. They will just need one burst of a person to punch through their ennui and jolt them out of their minds. This sudden shining experience may give them faith that external objective happiness still exists for them. All their accumulated self-confirmations about the dullness of people can’t stand up against that one blazing example. They will become more receptive to possibilities and give people more chances, which can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>It’s by e.e. cummings and goes like this:</p>

<p>since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world</p>

<p>my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don’t cry
—the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids’ flutter which says</p>

<p>we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life’s not a paragraph</p>

<p>And death i think is no parenthesis</p>

<p>I am not too big on the last part when the grammar metaphors come; I guess that ties in with “syntax” in the beginning. The simple phrases really get to me though. <em>since feeling is first, my blood approves, lady I swear by all flowers. Don’t cry, we are for each other:</em> Oh yes.</p>

When someone mentions to me that one time when so and so did this and that, the event could have happened during any of the past five years. Does this pass???</p>

<p>Kids make good time gauges. You can see the years go by right in front you in convenient physical form. I suspect empty nest syndrome comprises the sort of after-college time disorientation I feel now; a second wave of it.</p>

<p>So. I can’t stand nonchalance wielded as broadcast of how much you’ve seen and done. It’s douchey.</p>

<p>I went to Candlestick Park for the very first time. The place is so brutal; it’s all concrete and screaming and spilled drinks. When I got inside, the field seemed to be at the bottom of a loud writhing hole and I felt momentarily bad for the players having to endure that. Athletic abilities aside, I could never imagine being down there. I felt claustrophobic.</p>

<p>People’s attention spans are short, everything blows over, this too shall pass, the world is subjective, and you are immaterial, like dust in the wind.</p>

<p>We will transcend biology one day and become immortal. The coolest way is if we all upload our brains to the internet.</p>

<p>Persistence and habit are all you need for success. I was going to say this is true most of the time, but I’ll just leave that out and make it absolute.</p>

<p>Work for yourself. Avoid the awful scenario of being 50 and unemployed.</p>

<p>I hate corporations, whose whole point is profit, emphasizes greed, and takes out all the individual human accountability and motives, allows the deferral of responsibility to a faceless concept, the ruthless and inhuman nature of firms is just doing business.</p>

<p>I listen the hell out of new songs I like until they’re dry and withered, barren husks on the ground.</p>

<p>“You look like someone who contributes to a 401k.”
“You look like someone who doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Understanding weakens resolute decisive action. Just kill the monsters, no thinking allowed.</p>

<p>The inelasticity of old friends. The momentum of them. Are they like family then. Non-chosen.</p>

<p>As I walked, the passing headlights behind me lifted up my shadow and seemed to fix it to the wall. For a moment, as the car was passing, I see my legs moving on the wall, walking in place.</p>

<p>How do people keep from colliding.</p>

<p>Speaking out just enough to not be pegged as apathetic, choice words, not half-assed and random. The end result is this strange vague sense of mystery. Attributed to not knowing you well enough, no pattern. The scattershot of your select utterances throws off the trail.</p>

<p>Your happiness-checks are slowing down the servers.</p>

<p>y so srs</p>

<p>The oldest song in the world is a lullaby.</p>

<p>I reflexively recoil when I see a group of people all looking down at the phones. If it’s just one person, that doesn’t seem to be a problem. This holds for other things too. Talking politely. Crying. Walking down the street. I prefer to take people in the singular.</p>

<p>You can’t show a good picture of everyone looking down at their phones without disgusting people. It’s the same with a picture showing a group of people staring at their computers, I guess. This isn’t true with reading books. There is a site that shows people reading books in the subway and it’s hella fashionable and attractive. Why is this? Something about phones and technology are intrinsically repulsive? I don’t know.</p>

<p>“Hello! How do you do?”
“How do you do what?”</p>

<p>I don’t like getting to know people at the sandwich shops and lunch places or getting familiar. I want my foot-long served to me by anonymous drones!!</p>

<p>We would have these long text conversations that last for years, which we don’t talk about or allude to in person. It’s completely separate. It’s created this cool sort of subtext to our relationship.</p>

<p>What’s the deal with the old McDonald’s in Chinatown disappearing? How can McDonald’s ever do so bad that they have to shut down a location? I need answers!</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">T</span>his is true for me, and I think it’s probably true enough in the general: people appreciate reactions more than actions from other people. A reaction from someone is a reward, an affirmation and acknowledgement of whatever you did. An action from someone is just them trying to gain something for themselves.</p>

<p>Foooor example: I get more out of seeing someone’s face when I give them a present than any present they can give me. I prefer making someone laugh than hearing a good joke. When I meet someone, I remember and like those who listen and show interest much more than people who talk about their backpacking adventure in Budapest or Mediterranean cooking class or charity marathon they’re raising money for or novel they’re writing or their band’s summer tour or their start-up’s venture capital problems or their kids’ home runs or their wicked hangovers or their latest epiphanies about social interactions—sorry, got carried away. Anyway.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">H</span>aving children seems to be a requirement for a meaningful life. You can be the crappiest person, but as long as you have a kid, you are redeemed. You can be a hella rich, good-looking, profoundly generous and charitable <i>genius</i> but you will mean less, in the end, if you don’t have children. You would be considered incomplete if not suspect. Something must be wrong, you’re missing some organs, <i>something</i> must have derailed you.</p>

<p>I’m bringing this up because it’s another one of those unthinking, unexamined, “natural” things in the default settings of society that I hate. “Have kid” is checked under preferences (just under “Get married” and “Buy a house”), and if you uncheck it, there’s bound to be a concerned dialogue pop-up asking if you’re sure.</p>

<p>Times are changing though. People are choosing; they are not getting married and not having kids. Why? Because they are happier that way.</p>

<p>(An unthinking, unexamined default setting I like is “Wear clothes.”)</p>

<p>I just got expansions for Small World, the game we’re lavishing our attention on at the moment. It’s Risk with more colors, more strategy, and a whole lot less dice-rolling. Watch the first episode of Tabletop for a taste.</p>

<p>I didn’t appreciate the importance and timing of declining, which is the core of the game I think. Declining lets you abandon your current race and pick a new one. It perfectly hits on the feelings of relief and sense of renewal that come with quitting and abandoning something. Of course, there’s no guarantee that something better will come along, but the unknown in this case is not feared but coveted. Like that sleazebag manager demonstrated in Almost Famous, given option A on an open palm and an Option B hidden in the closed fist, you will always choose the fist.</p>

A few days here, a few days there, it was too fast for anything to really sink in. If I wanted to gain worldliness and all the coveted traits of a well-traveled person, I’d need to actually <i>be</i> there—a month, a year, <i>a while</i>—long enough to simmer with the people and get grounding of the place.

<p>I just woke up from a nap, had some soup, and am planning to stay up for a while. Winter is such a reflective season with the cold, the ending of the year and start of the next, the time off. Favorite season by far. I can see myself migrating north for the summer.</p>

<p>Coldplay’s Christmas Lights instantly feels and sounds like a Christmas song; I don’t know how they did it.</p>

<p><em>Those Christmas lights, light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on</em></p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">I</span> have taken an extremely hedonistic tack lately. I don’t mean like rock stars and orgies. It’s more me obeying my whims at a particular moment, apropos of nothing. It’s very indulgent. This also includes not doing anything I don’t want to do, even if it’s good for me.</p>

<p>I feel no guilt doing this, as I used to. I trust myself, by now, to have internalized a good set of basic instincts and boundaries. I will not end up in ditch.</p>

<p>Time is the only precious thing and I don’t want to waste any more of it not enjoying myself.</p>

<p>I just found out Wordpress has this cool fullscreen mode. Everything fades and you just see a cursor and your words.</p>

<p>I decided to use NaNoWriMo this year to make myself write. It sort of worked. I wrote about 4,000 words so far, over several sessions at the Blue Danube and a few times during the hour before bed. It feels awesome to pound down whatever I’m thinking without editing onto the page and to just keep on going without looking back. The hardest part has always been getting started, to actually stop whatever I’m doing and to shift my brain over to writing. That problem will always be there. Now, though, I don’t have to worry whether I’ll produce any words. You know how it’s impossible to tell your brain to stop thinking? I just wait for thoughts to materialize and write those down. It’s a fountain!</p>

<p>That’s Amanda Palmer playing the ukulele.</p>

<p>I had the easiest, fastest time at the Comcast store this afternoon. It was incredible. I had been dreading going there and dealing with the customer service. It has a horrendous rep. But it was OK! I needed to exchange a broken cable box for another one; I thought I would have to drive back and get the remote and the coaxial cable that originally came with the box; it seemed like something bad customer service people will nitpick about and demand before they would help you. I also braced myself for having to explain that I wasn’t the person on the bill and was trying to think of ways to prove that I hadn’t stolen the cable box and was trying to scam them. In the end, the guy scanned the box, drew up my dad’s records, asked what was wrong, and went in the back and got me another box. That just rocked.</p>

<p>Last night at Kevin’s Noodle House, during one of the best pho experiences in my life, we talked about how someone we knew was stable enough in life that even if a baby suddenly appears in their life, they would be able to handle it. That really stuck with me. Having a kid is the most disruptive, expensive, life-changing thing that can possibly happen to you. To be able to withstand and take in stride that immense shock to your system, that’s just wow. That will be my high water mark. I will aim to have all my emotional and financial shit so together that nothing, not even a baby, can assail my life.</p>

<p>Victoria is back SF for a week! This is going to be so fun.</p>

<p>I learned a new word. It’s lagniappe. It’s the little extra something a storekeeper gives you for good measure when you buy something. That’s a really cool practice and I’d like to see that happen more often. Like haggling.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">I</span> picked up Lawrence and Gordon at midnight and headed south. The Orionids were peaking and we needed to get away from the city. Gordon brought along chicken and sugar cookies.</p>

<p>I had Coyote Lake in mind if we couldn’t find anywhere closer to watch the meteors, but there was really no destination in particular. I was trying to make a point of it, of course, I would. A few minutes after the buzzing dome of light that was San Jose, I turned off onto a likely seeming exit and made for the low hills to the east of 101. It was hella dark.</p>

<p>After squiggling up a few narrow winding miles, we parked, got out, and looked up. Holy shit. I don’t remember ever seeing the sky like that. There were the usual constellations, but among them and all over, there was this absolute <i>smear</i> of fainter stars in gauzy clusters. Whether I saw any meteors or not, that first look was pretty much all I needed from the trip. I knew those stars and planets were always there and knew what I was missing, everyone did, we who lived in light-polluted places. It didn’t lessen the impact. It was pure objectivity.</p>

<p>We saw the advertised shower, more like drizzle, pointing out the quick streaks of brightness every few minutes while Lawrence said where. I got up on the windshield. Ate cheese. Peed in the dark. We saw Orion’s penis.</p>

<p>You can’t just ask anyone to go look for meteors with you. There is a lot of quiet and darkness in between the flashes of light, and they might feel compelled to point out how small the universe makes them feel or ask what it all means. In some significantly hushed profound-voice, they will bust out their epiphanies to share. There would be no penises or chicken, only halting attempts at funless meaning.</p>

<p>I had this great idea for a science fiction story where people use time as currency and would work to add minutes and hours to their lifespans. Then I found out a movie was coming out with the exact same premise! With Justin Timberlake! Goddamn it, I’ve been scooped. THEN I found out Harlan Ellison was suing the movie for ripping off his short story with the same premise, which he wrote in 19 effing <i>65</i>. GODDAMN IT.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">T</span>he bridge, please,” she said, as she got in.</p>

<p>The cabbie glanced at her and pulled out into the empty streets. The headlights swept through a churning wall of fog.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she said, “Don’t worry, I’m not going to go jump off or anything, if that’s what you’re thinking, which I think you are. Naturally you would. It’s three in the morning for crying out loud!” She laughed. The cabbie slowed down as the fog got denser.</p>

<p>She was silent for a couple more minutes, then said, “I’m meeting someone there. A friend. An old friend I haven’t seen for a long time.” Suddenly she broke off and laughed again. “That’s so morose. I’m not talking about <i>Death</i>, or being metaphorical or anything! It sure sounds like that though. Oh man.” She turned away from the window and looked at the rearview to check that he understood. “Don’t want you to misunderstand, and lock the doors and take me to the police station or something. Can you lock the doors from the inside? Like in a police car? I’ve never been in one, just picked that up from TV and such.”</p>

<p>She turned back to the window and gazed out at the white fog turned dark yellow under the sodium streetlights. The cabbie turned on the heat and defroster.</p>

<p>“That’s nice, thank you. I was getting a little chilly.” She kept her eyes on the window. Darkness shrouded with white, made soft. There was nothing clear outside.</p>

<p>The cabbie slowed down more as they neared the water. He turned on the wipers.</p>

<p>The bridge appeared around the bend, and loomed, lit from below by floodlights. The lights didn’t reach all the way up; the tops of the towers were lost in the dark and haze and seemed to extend high forever.</p>

<p>The cabbie stopped in the parking lot. She hesitated, then leaned over and said, “Hey, do you mind waiting here for me? I won’t be long. I’ll be back.” She hesitated again, then, “Please wait for me, it’s important. I don’t—I don’t want—” She looked away, blinking. She paid the fare and said, “Keep the change,” and rushed out.</p>

<p>The cabbie watched the fog swallow her.</p>

It was really down to earth; there are no gimmicks, everyone behaved as you would expect normal people to behave in those situations. The ending was natural. Though it didn’t have any explosions or flash, it kept my attention pretty much throughout. I’d want to read the book if it had been based on a novel, which I don’t think it is, just to see more of how an epidemic would disrupt the everyday.</p>

<p>Victoria’s in Chicago; I miss her. It’s a brave thing to do, to trek out on your own to another city and make a new home there. Just like that. Inspiring.</p>

<p>I had a dream the other day that produced a perfect phrase to describe some of the fantasy I’ve been reading. My subconscious rocks!</p>

<p>I dreamt I was at Comic-Con, wandering around. Someone mentioned the epic fantasy panel was going on RIGHT NOW and I had totally messed up the date and time or whatever and panicked and ran for it. I arrived at this stage with surprisingly few people in the audience. Relieved, I found a spot on the floor and sat. They were just beginning. J.K. Rowling was there. She started talking about something, and I had a sudden feeling I wasn’t at the right place. I didn’t recognize anyone else on the panel onstage and looked around. The person next to me must have sensed my confusion and said this:</p>

<p>“Fantasy accounting is the panel across the hall.”</p>

<p>Writer-consciousness is my biggest problem with stories. In lots of the epic fantasy I read, the story and characters, the plot, everything the reader cares about, all take backseat to the author stumbling over themselves showing off their thoroughly thought-out worlds, profound philosophies, magic systems, well-researched societies, alien biology, and on and on. This is <i>accounting</i>. I can literally see the splay of spreadsheets and flowcharts and outlines overflowing with minutia.</p>

<p>I like to be immersed in the story as much as the next fantasy fan, and the creation of a believable and detailed secondary world is the whole point; it’s the stumbling-over-themselves-showing-off part that I’m taking issue with. It’s the urge to use their books as some poster board to exhibit every clever thing they’ve ever imagined that I can’t stand.</p>

<p>Authors, be invisible. I command it!</p>

Bad things heal, blow over, fade, run its course; are forgiven, forgotten. Enough problems fix themselves this way, without me lifting a finger, that now, when problems arise, my response has degenerated from the noble impulse to act and fix things to me first considering whether it’s something that’ll fix itself eventually, somehow. And the scales are not fair; <em>of course</em> my thumb is on the it’ll fix itself side.</p>

<p>I am on a plateau again. I’ve been climbing these past few rocky years after graduation, and things are flat once more. But unlike the college plateau, this place has no clear four-year, 180-unit edges; it seems it can just go on and on.

<p>I’m looking for a third place. I mean, home is the first place, work is the second place, and there is this third place where you can go when you don’t want to be at home or at work. Bars serve this really well, but too bad bars aren’t for me, or I’m not for bars. Borders used to be a third place, vaguely at one time, but they’re all closing and it’s not the same.

         <p><span id="dropcap">S</span>o I’m pretty sick, the sickest I’ve been for a long time. I thought a good night’s rest would cure me, like normal times before, but this bout of <i>disease</i> lingered through the night and totally disabled me in the morning. I was kind of scared for an instant that this might not be in the realm of ailments Walgreens would have a fix for. Then I felt better, and I’ve been drinking strong tea and reading Couch by Benjamin Parzybok. Soup too. My hoodie up.</p>

<p>I am not sure what I have, not really a fever or cold or flu…just a sort of nausea and need to lie down. I tried Nyquil but other than putting me to sleep, don’t really think it helped.</p>

<p>The blurry picture there is from Fort Point, where the barracks are. The doorways go on and on and it was really arresting when I first saw it. I was going to put up one with me in it, at the end of the tunnel, but the lighting was somehow wrong and it was like I was stuck in layers and layers of darkness. Ominous for a post about sickness!</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">I</span>‘ve been living alone for five months now, and I learned these things:</p>

<p>The heater requires the pilot light to be on <em>all the time</em> to operate. I mean, what. I couldn’t get over the fact that there is an open flame just burning in the room. If the light goes out, you have to strike a match, open up the gas valve, and stick in the lit match into the stream of hissing gas.</p>

<p>Traffic at night on the 101 offramp sounds a lot like waves at Ocean Beach. Well, not so much the honking. I grew up living close to the ocean and would sometimes leave my window open a crack to hear the water when I sleep. I’m now as far from the ocean as I can get in the city and this is an unexpected comfort.</p>

<p>Coasters are crucial!</p>

<p>Oatmeal is a really fast breakfast. I get the rolled kind that comes in flakes. I put some in water, and it’s ready by the time the water boils.</p>

<p>Living alone does not mean being alone.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">I</span> used to be part of a pokemon forum when I was in high school and it drew me in, meant more to me at the time, like nothing else I’ve encountered before—and if I really really think truly about it, like nothing else since.</p>

<p>I remember having the forum on my mind all the time, jotting down little notes throughout the day on what I would post when I got back home. It was what I did online, what the internet was <em>for</em>. Of course, it wasn’t ever about pokemon. The sense of belonging and community was immense.</p>

<p>I played out all forms of immature behavior there, spamming, flaming people, ego tripping, a lot of ego tripping, and indulging in all the rotten things a kid could indulge in when they don’t have that zoomed-out awareness to feel bad about them. Everything had direct relations. I got online I was happy, I got off I was sad. It’s funny.</p>

<p>I’m chewing this particular fat because I finally started reading Women in Love and all these things are jumping out at me. Specifically, I’m talking about people who have it in the head. This particular line just blows me away.</p>

<p>“What is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the animal instincts?”</p>

<p>It’s so easy to appreciate what I’ve lost, to see how great I had it when I didn’t know or realize, and it just sucks so hard, SO HARD lol, to know now I can’t go back there, go home. I’ll need to look for something else besides ignorant bliss to get me through, and I have a gut suspicion it would require lots of work and pain and will.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">T</span>here are certain words and phrases that try to stop you from thinking. They intend to make you accept a certain meaning without further consideration, to take it as given. A friend talked about this a long while ago. I think he was talking about persuasion or the media, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>“Terrorist” and “Nazi” and the old dependable “God works in mysterious ways,” but also “freedom” and “firefighter” and “book.”</p>

<p>These terms are dead ends in your brain. Once you hear “activist judge,” you’re not supposed to think too much about what that means and just take the provided connotation whole hog—in this case, it means the judge will buttrape your kids. The sacred must be destroyed.</p>

I went to a screening that bundled the fifth and sixth movies with the midnight release, back to back to back, for <em>eight and a half hours</em>, arggghg!! I had a very good time. It was around the middle of Half-Blood Prince four hours in that I got really euphoric and loved everything that was going on. During the previews before Deathly Hallows, a group yelled out “Ten points to Gryffindor!” in a British accent. Another group called them nerds and everyone laughed.</p>

<p>I saw Explosions in the Sky again on Monday. Magnificient! They were playing a special show to raise money for their sick friend, and they played <em>hard</em>. They were much louder than I remembered before, power poured from them in waves, the floor shook with bass. They built up and reached crescendo again and again and the guitarists and bass players swung full-armed, hammering across their strings in unison. The drummer broke his drumstick. Man. Their music kills cancer.</p>

Daylight savings time just ended—or began?—daylight savings time <em>happened</em>; anyway, I gained back an hour. I will never ever understand daylight savings time, how anyone first thought of it, how they then successfully explained and conveyed that thought to the public, and precisely just how they managed to convince everyone that such a messy hassle—which requires the concerted effort of the entire population twice a year and introduces a great deal of chaos and variation into something as fixed and depended upon as <em>the time</em>—is a good idea. I’m sure it <em>is </em>a good idea, somehow, an ingenious exercise of manipulating an abstraction for profit. It just annoys me that I can’t ever hope to approach that level of articulation and sway, that sell-a-penguin-some-ice force of will that can get everybody to voluntarily shorten one of their springtime days by a whole hour for no apparent reason.</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">T</span>here’s been a coming back of sorts recently. Lawrence, Connie, Kevin Man, and Gordon are all back in the city after their own ways of being away. Myself, I haven’t been anywhere, but feel adrift. I haven’t had much time to write and collect my thoughts, maybe that’s why. There’s lots of whirlwind and events passing by without me giving them proper notice, and people I’ve met I should follow up with. It really disturbs me to think of people I will never see again, because we were too busy or whatever to get together again after the initial meeting. They might as well have <em>died</em>, from my perspective. And this means that <em>I</em> might as well have died from <em>their </em>perspective. These little subjective deaths really add up.</p>

<p>Baseball is blue balls, on all levels—anti-climaxes and sudden resets are everywhere. The strikes a pitcher throws only matter if they reach three. No matter how great the first two strikes are, if the batter walks or gets a hit, those hard-earned strikes are meaningless for the game and don’t add to anything cumulative. For the batter, all the effort they put into getting on base and stealing bases and all that pays off only if they can get back home. You can get hits all day long, but if they don’t turn into runs, they’re also trivial in the final outcome of the game. Winning games, still, is full of wasted effort. You can still lose a best-of-seven series if you win three games. All that effort in winning those games, again, come to naught. The only validating end point is winning the World Series, but even that, is not an end all. There will be another World Series next year. There is no end all! All victories are temporary, someone said. In that, I think sports, especially baseball, is like life. It’s just a series of plateaus, one after another, after another, with no summit. Which gets to what I want to say: life is blue balls!</p>

<p>I built a shelf, which is AWESOME. I am hella proud.</p>

<p>Vegetables perish so fast, eat them quickly!</p>

<p>I still don’t have the internet yet because my apartment strangely wasn’t wired for cable and the last tenant didn’t even have internet access, even stranger. But it hasn’t been that bad. I really don’t do <em>anything</em> online and the things I really need to do I do at work.</p>

<p>I didn’t remember waking up—just like how I can’t ever know when I fall asleep, oooh, incepted!—but I did remember doing my reflexive day-of-the-week check. What day is it? Is it a weekday??? Oh, it’s Sunday, awesome, relief, back to sleep.</p>

<p>I had dim sum with my grandmother at our usual tea house on Noriega. Because we’ve been there so many times, I can really tell how much the quality varies. Today was one of the better days; the lotus leaf-wrapped rice was nicely seasoned. My grandmother usually talks about the old country and dim sum prices at other restaurants and how little I’m eating. I would reply in bad Chinese and eat some more and my mind wanders a lot.</p>

<p>How do dolphins sleep and not drown?</p>

<p>Gordon called a little after noon after lindy in the park. I was supposed to buy a boxspring with my parents, but didn’t know where they were at that moment so had nothing substantial to relay to Gordon about my afternoon plans.</p>

<p>DSL is not available at my apartment, wtf! With a heavy heart, I ordered Comcast. $19.99 a month for six months, then $40.95 after that. Plus modem. Plus taxes. Fees. And 7% of my incorporeal soul.</p>

<p>Then I ran. I haven’t jogged for a few weeks and was glad to take advantage of the late-breaking sunshine. It felt really good. My favorite route cuts through the middle of Lake Merced. There’s a bridge there once you get inside the golf course, with a water fountain to boot.</p>

<p>As I walked home swigging some sugar-free Red Bull with a new stick of deodorant in my back pocket, I thought I caught a glimpse of a coworker. We made eye contact for a split second and I was passed. It was totally her, I concluded. I wondered if she recognized me with my Aplia cap and can of soda over my face in half swig.</p>

<p>I bet!</p>

<p>I have a $25 gift card for Barnes and Noble from a few months ago. What book should I spend it on?</p>

<p>I’m looking for my first apartment, it’s happening! I’m moving out! I have this very vivid image in my mind, of me sitting on the floor with partly opened cardboard boxes around me, stacks of papers and notebooks. It’s only then would I reread my journals, <em>could</em> read them with enough distance in time. I’m maudlin.</p>

These three are easily related I bet, lots of loamy potential here for analysis if you’re into it.</p>

<p>Then I have this other sort of dream that’s one step better than a nightmare, not as heart-pounding but still pretty awful. I would drink too much before bed. And my bladder, under mounting pressure with no sign of relief from its unresponsive owner, sends an urgent distress call to my brain to assemble elaborate dreams of myself peeing, so I would think I’ve peed already and relax. But my subconscious is militarized (yeah baby lol!) and I would notice how weird things are, like a toilet would keep following me around, <em>beckoning</em>, and I snap awake. The relief is immense. And not just from going to the bathroom for real either~ It’s good to know my mind is keen enough to see through my treacherous bladder’s machinations. My dignity is intact!</p>

         <p><span id="dropcap">I</span> moved to a new spot at work, it’s fabulous. I now have a window! This is a decidedly significant upgrade from the <em>wall</em> I used to stare at. I can see cars crossing the Bay Bridge and a big fat palm tree; all of this overlooking the Embarcadero and its wonderfully distracting activity and foot traffic.</p>

<p>My new seat also puts me in the main pod of the production team. I don’t have to warm up the huskies for the overland expedition from my remote outpost of a cubicle to talk to my coworkers anymore. The strange thing is, we still mainly talk through e-mail even though we all sit right next to each other. I just sent a “thanks” to someone five feet away, when in all measures of efficiency and basic social sense, I should have just turned my head and thanked them verbally.</p>

<p>It bothered me and I thought about it for a while—with lots of staring out the magnificent window—and came up with a brilliant justification. Face-to-face interaction is so precious now that it’s reserved for the really important things, stuff that requires immediate attention. Like, your hair’s on fire. Everything else, such as my thank you, can be relegated to the inbox for reaction later. If I had thanked him in person, I would be improperly elevating my thank you to the high priority space of hair fire! No, let’s not disrupt the momentum of our industrious locomotion.</p>

For the past week, I’ve been listening to their songs with headphones on the bus, trying hard to restrain myself from swaying or nodding my head too conspicuously, and watching their concert videos and footage on YouTube, and just totally getting all psyched for the show. There was one song in particular I was looking forward to, needed to see: the last song on their latest album, and their finale, Everlasting Light. They do this really cool maneuver at the climax where the bass and both guitar players all turn toward the drummer behind them and just rock hard to the end, facing and playing for each other in a circle as a band, with the audience made truly only a witness to their music.</p>

<p>None of my friends knew about them before the concert, and I was worried they wouldn’t like it. After a while though, I sort of stopped worrying about that, about most things, actually. I was somewhere else. I hope I see them again.</p>

What color Mini Cooper should I buy first, red or green? Delightful! And I like sorting stuff to begin with. Later, I’d forget about my ticket, and get a nice little jot of surprise once I see it in my wallet again, and remember, hey, yeah, I could be a millionaire lol.

A flock of bright green parrots were flying and jubbling around the Embarcadero all excited, making noise and playing with each other among the cherry blossoms. I took out my camera too, then, and think I got a few good shots.</p>

<p>My desktop is in cardiac arrest and things look pretty grim. After days of reading random forum posts for a cure—the method of choice for solving any tech issue—and performing the extremely risky BIOS flashing, twice!, the computer is still out cold.

<p>Pyr is having an essay contest! I’m so entering.</p>

<p>Connie’s in her apartment, all’s right with the world! The whole moving process with mattresses and U-Hauls and eating take-out on the floor was pretty great, looking back. When it was happening though, it was totally exhausting and nerve-wracking. I wish I took pictures.</p>
