      <p>The other day I drove to Monterey. I had an audiobook on and was really getting into the story. It was about how a Facebook/Google-like company incrementally monopolizes data and brings on a survelliance state dystopia. It reminded me about my Facebook account which I never use and I was like oh and deleted it. Twitter is still great, can’t live without that!</p>

<p>It took me a long time to decide on what kind of hotel I wanted. I reflexively wanted something cheap. Saving money is pretty pleasurable, and can outweigh or offset the pleasure of a nicer room, say. I thought I wanted somewhere quiet too. Remote, set back a bit from a busy road. But I didn’t want something like a cabin in the woods, not that kind of quiet. Not rustic. The best hotel room I ever stayed at was a Best Western in Brookings, Oregon, right next to the beach. It was perfect. I wanted something like that, only different. Hours later, I had rejected highrise Marriotts and little bed-and-breakfast inns, and picked this place in a residential area that used to be condos so the rooms were in clusters of three in their own houses and had strangely spacious floor plans.</p>

<p>Psychologically, staying three nights is the best.</p>

<p>The other other day I went camping with Erica for her birthday. I brought my ski jacket and space blanket and puffy jacket and was totally ready for the cold. I wasn’t. I froze all night. Moving an inch in any direction exposed my body to like a -50 degree drop in temperature. It was ridiculous, my muscles were tensed and strained from trying not to move. I breathed in air that cored my soul. Erica’s sister had the right idea. She had two sleeping pads, a mummy sleeping bag inside of another sleeping bag, all under two more blankets on top. I need to go camping when it’s really hot. No more of this icicle living!</p>

<p>I chopped wood with an axe for the first time, which was satisfying.</p>
