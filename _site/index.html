      <p>There’s never a good time to talk about writing. I’ve learned to not talk about it around people. It doesn’t get me anything and no one cares. I could write about it all day long though!</p>

<p>I wonder how much happier I would be if I just stopped writing and ended the struggle. Every day I could come home and just relax and watch movies and play video games. Weekends too. Whenever I have free time, I could just be free. I could pick up new hobbies, less solitary ones that are readily gratifying. I would also be able to talk about something else besides writing. I’m becoming totally one-dimensional.</p>

<p>I agonized last night about a character for hours, going back and forth, weighing the consequences, and drawing together and following threads. I still haven’t figured out anything and can’t move on easily and focus with the frayed ends waving loose around my face. It’s never a wall or a block in my way. It’s also been haze and swamps.</p>

<p>I think I might just be doing it to do it. Sheer stubbornness. There has to be some payoff somewhere here. At least complaining about this precious problem is fun.</p>

<p>My dragon story got rejected last night. I’m bummed. I put it back up on Kindle. While I was there, I checked my sales and got super excited when I saw I got some page reads for my lottery story. It’s so rare that I ever get any activity on the dashboard but when I do, it feels <i>amazing</i> like nothing else. I also like getting page reads more than discrete sales in that I could see that someone has actually read through the story. So great.</p>

<p>Couch moving was a success. When you have a couch, a TV, and something to put your feet on, you have it all. Elbert got a U-Haul with an illegal Lawrence in the back and there’s no part of riding around in a van moving stuff around that is anything but good times.</p>
