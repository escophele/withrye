  <p>Laundry takes forever to do. If I start loading the washer at 8, I can expect to finish folding at midnight. This doesn’t even include the ironing, the endless ironing. The building’s dryer is hella weak; it takes two full cycles to dry my clothes, so two hours. Maybe my load is too big.</p>

<p>Twitter is awesome, it is known. If anything, anywhere, happens, you can search for it. Information gets to you faster than a web page can pop up in Google’s search results. This is omniscience.</p>

<p>I had a dream the other day that produced a perfect phrase to describe some of the fantasy I’ve been reading. My subconscious rocks!</p>

<p>I dreamt I was at Comic-Con, wandering around. Someone mentioned the epic fantasy panel was going on RIGHT NOW and I had totally messed up the date and time or whatever and panicked and ran for it. I arrived at this stage with surprisingly few people in the audience. Relieved, I found a spot on the floor and sat. They were just beginning. J.K. Rowling was there. She started talking about something, and I had a sudden feeling I wasn’t at the right place. I didn’t recognize anyone else on the panel onstage and looked around. The person next to me must have sensed my confusion and said this:</p>

<p>“Fantasy accounting is the panel across the hall.”</p>

<p>Writer-consciousness is my biggest problem with stories. In lots of the epic fantasy I read, the story and characters, the plot, everything the reader cares about, all take backseat to the author stumbling over themselves showing off their thoroughly thought-out worlds, profound philosophies, magic systems, well-researched societies, alien biology, and on and on. This is <i>accounting</i>. I can literally see the splay of spreadsheets and flowcharts and outlines overflowing with minutia.</p>

<p>I like to be immersed in the story as much as the next fantasy fan, and the creation of a believable and detailed secondary world is the whole point; it’s the stumbling-over-themselves-showing-off part that I’m taking issue with. It’s the urge to use their books as some poster board to exhibit every clever thing they’ve ever imagined that I can’t stand.</p>

<p>Authors, be invisible. I command it!</p>
