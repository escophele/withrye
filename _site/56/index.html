   <p><span id="dropcap">O</span>regon! I spent five days on the road with Chris, Amy, and Hieu-Nam last weekend, looping up California, around Portland, and back down the coast. The trip is just starting to blur in and mix, tinting my life a bit greener.</p>

<p>Everything had that loamy saturation of color, like after a storm. And the TREES. Everywhere everywhere. I will never see as many.</p>

<p>Crater Lake joins the Grand Canyon as places you have to see in person. My body rocked when I first walked up and saw the water. This is what it’s about.</p>

<p>I still got the uneasy small town feeling, every time I go anywhere outside a city. I don’t belong here, I keep thinking. I’m too used to the massive, pervasive indifference from people in cities, the comfort of strangers. There isn’t enough!</p>

<p>Our lighthouse tour guide—it was her last day—gave us more time up near the lamp and told us about the haunted bed-and-breakfast down the road. She was very effective.</p>

<p>We saw the only rain of the trip that day. But magically, a window of sunshine opened up, beginning a little after we arrived at the lighthouse until precisely when the tour ended. The ghost must have favored us and wanted us to be happy.</p>

<p>We were driving through the redwoods slowly, then Icona Pop came on and it was the best thing evar.</p>

<p>I have so many pictures I want to post. It was awesome to find out Amy was into photography too. Between the four of us, we have like 4,000 images lol.</p>

<p>I used to be a lot more thorough with recaps, but I’ve lost the urge to give complete accounts. Now I just output these disjointed paragraphs. I will get those pictures up though. I look forward to doing something with Flickr.</p>

<p>I think I know the source of my travel bug. I’m all transitory and nebulous here, and I don’t feel much gravity. Traveling is transitory and nebulous too, only it’s more <i>interesting</i>. It’s what I noticed after Korea, and more so this time, my increasing homelessness.</p>
