   <p><span id="dropcap">H</span>aving children seems to be a requirement for a meaningful life. You can be the crappiest person, but as long as you have a kid, you are redeemed. You can be a hella rich, good-looking, profoundly generous and charitable <i>genius</i> but you will mean less, in the end, if you don’t have children. You would be considered incomplete if not suspect. Something must be wrong, you’re missing some organs, <i>something</i> must have derailed you.</p>

<p>I’m bringing this up because it’s another one of those unthinking, unexamined, “natural” things in the default settings of society that I hate. “Have kid” is checked under preferences (just under “Get married” and “Buy a house”), and if you uncheck it, there’s bound to be a concerned dialogue pop-up asking if you’re sure.</p>

<p>Times are changing though. People are choosing; they are not getting married and not having kids. Why? Because they are happier that way.</p>

<p>(An unthinking, unexamined default setting I like is “Wear clothes.”)</p>
