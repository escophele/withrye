  <p>Bonfire! It was the best one, the culmination of years of trials and <i>fire study</i>. We had tents, there were marshmallows, we had we, and lots of light and dark all around. Getting a fire ring was pretty tough, ours was the last one left when Elbert claimed it. At <i>3 p.m</i>.</p>

<p>I have a $25 gift card for Barnes and Noble from a few months ago. What book should I spend it on?</p>

<p>I’m looking for my first apartment, it’s happening! I’m moving out! I have this very vivid image in my mind, of me sitting on the floor with partly opened cardboard boxes around me, stacks of papers and notebooks. It’s only then would I reread my journals, <i>could</i> read them with enough distance in time. I’m maudlin.</p>
