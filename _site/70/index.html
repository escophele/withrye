   <p>Lately, I’ve been trying to do cumulative things. Things like saving money, running more, meeting people. Adding a little, over time. I won’t be ready for the big events, I guess. Like that Bright Eyes song, right, I’d rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery.</p>

<p>I went up to the lady sitting behind the sign-in sheet and introduced myself. She gave me a look and asked if I had been here before. I said no, it was my first time. She shrugged. I made a mark next to my name and sat down.</p>

<p>The cafe was on a really quiet residential street and it was just as quiet on the inside. Everyone typed on their laptops and sipped from thick mugs. I was there for a writing session, where people sat together and just wrote for an hour or two. It sounded contradictory when I read the event description. I mean, what was the point of doing solitary things together?</p>

<p>There were two other first-timers at my table, and one regular. He was working on a fantasy book too. The first newcomer liked unreliable narrators. I wasn’t sure what the third person was working on, but she had asthma and apologized for coughing so much and reassured us that she wasn’t spreading contagious germs.</p>

<p>It was nice talking with people who wrote. So there it was, the point. I spent three hours there and didn’t feel like I should be anywhere else or be doing anything else.</p>

<p>On the way back, it finally occurred to me why the sign-in lady thought she recognized me from somewhere. We freaking work in the same place. Crazy.</p>
