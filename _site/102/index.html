   <p>2016!</p>

<p>It’s true what they say about new experiences lengthening your perception of time. It’s only been about a year since I left my favorite Big Co job. It feels like forever ago.</p>

<p>I’m paring down internet distractions and it’s awesome. No more reddit. I get a thrill every time I crave wasting time online and then I refuse myself. It’s masochism, ascetism, right. I have a long row of bookmarks I’m shortening steadily.</p>

<p>Will focus bring me meaning? I think so. It’s being deliberate and intentional, and that more than anything has never failed to satisfy. Results then don’t matter as much if at all. It’s in this way, I think, that people eventually lose touch with easy delights and become monks or something, where every pleasure is indirect and has to be acquired or worked for.</p>

<p>I’m in cafes all the time now and started drinking a lot of coffee. Anything to get away from the house. The coffee thing is not so much a reaction to my living situation as it is just a side effect of being in a coffee shop. At this cafe, there are weekly board game meetups. I went to a few, and it was how I discovered the cafe. Nowadays, I just drink coffee and ignore the board games.</p>

<p>I’m driving more too, now that I have a place to park at night. This is definitely a turn for the worse. I should bike again. It’ll be a great route going up along the ocean. This will also make up for my lack of exercise. My pullup bar doesn’t fit anymore and it’s been raining so I haven’t run. It’s been easy.</p>
