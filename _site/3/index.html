   <p><span id="dropcap">I</span>tâ€™s been so great lately. I was walking home, and saw this group of people with their cameras out. They were all looking up, captivated. A flock of bright green parrots were flying and jubbling around the Embarcadero all excited, making noise and playing with each other among the cherry blossoms. I took out my camera too, then, and think I got a few good shots.</p>
