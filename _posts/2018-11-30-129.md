The trip was pretty good. I rode Amtrak to Denver to see what a long train ride felt like. I slept when I was sleepy and ate and looked out the window at the amazing scenery. Didn't write at all though. I was in a sleeper car, which was nice. The privacy was ready and immediate. I woke up at dawn to a frosted red desert rolling by. That was very vivid.

In Denver, I ate and slept too. I wandered around and took pictures. I didn't go out of my way at all.
