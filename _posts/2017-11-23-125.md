I'm in a hotel in New Zealand, drinking Pocari Sweat. I'm waiting for Kevin Man to get here tomorrow with the rental car so I can get out of the city.

The most memorable moment, the instant that stuck out this trip so far was when I got properly onto the trail. It was a smaller path than I'm used to, and the vegetation was a lot closer in too. All this created this green cocooned feeling. Sound was immediately muffled, only pierced by birdsong. I felt heat radiating from all sides. The dirt was warm. I climbed and eventually poked up out of there and looked out and down at this super blue bay. And there was this one small boat slowly making its way across the frame in the middle of all the water. I took a million pictures.
