The king sat on his throne in front of a very long line of pastry chefs and dessert masters, each bearing their greatest creations for the annual tasting. One by one, scrumptious sweets and delicate delicacies went down the gullet of the king, and one by one, he summarily dismissed each chef.

"This is far too bland! This one, too fruity. This one, too rich!"

On and on the line moved forward, filling the king with unpleasurable pastries. The king grew with each bite, swelling past his throne and spilling onto the dias.

A baker's apprentice stepped forward. She held out a single cupcake, unadorned but with a single dollop of fresh cream. 

She presented the cake to the royal taster, who took her standard bite. The tester's eyes lit up.

"Sire! You must taste this. Best of the year's batch by far."

The king's eyebrows drew up in interest.

"Come! Let me have this cake."

The king tossed the cake wholly into his gaping mouth. 

He chewed, looking around, and chewed some more. The baker's apprentice stood very still, silent. She looked at the king, who was now ten times the size of anyone in the room.

The king swallowed, and spoke.
