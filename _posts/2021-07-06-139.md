There was a teahouse on the side of the road, amidst some willow trees next to a river where the water looped away. An examee, dusty and parched, rushed over to the nearest open table and unloaded her books and scrolls stacked high on her back cart. She as quickly took off the bright white, starchy square brimmed cap that once proudly marked her student class, but now sagged and drooped from sweat. She mopped her forehead with it, and then wiped her dirt-caked face. She grimaced at the hat, now streaked and limp, and put it back on.

It was midday. Most of the tables in the yard were occupied. Woodcutters and trappers from nearby villages sat next to their bundles of wood and furs. Some fanning themselves and sipping tea, others chatting. She also saw several white square hats scattered in the crowd. One held up a book in one hand while trying to eat with a spoon in the other. Another had covered the entire table with scrolls and was gulping tea straight from the pot.

Our examee, for one, wasn't going to study at the table. She caught the eye of the proprietor, who set down a steaming pot of old black and took her order. Porridge and a side of grilled trout. She poured herself some tea in the small cup, and slowly took a sip. Hot. She tried not to think about tomorrow. It was the last round of exams, and either she passed or she didn't. There was nothing more she could do at this point. Once she walked through the capital gates in the morning and stood before the civil board, her fate was out of her hands.

Or so she told herself. She took another sip.

So that's as far as I got. I don't know what happens next. It's just a backdrop and wallpaper for an actual story. I like the setting and exploring the space. I wish I had enough patience and motivation to write. I've pretty much given up on novels and know I could only realistically dabble in short stories, that kind of end abruptly after three paragraphs.
