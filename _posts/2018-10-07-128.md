I've been watching so much Twitch. I didn't get the attraction but now I totally do. It's live entertainment on demand.

More so. The live part of it means it doesn't need all my attention like watching a movie or playing a game or reading. It's not curated and just flows along. It slots into the background. I can engage and disengage as quickly as my attention span is short. Like regular old real life!

I also don't get the same guilt nagging me I should be doing something more productive because I can have Twitch on and work at the same time. Just half guilty. Amazing.
