Yeah baby! LEASE. BOOM. HAPPY DAY. Buyer's remorse hasn't set in (yet?) and my thoughts are all of shelves and desks and posters and frames and biking twenty minutes to work. Shows at Bottom of the Hill and all-night Risk and the balcony and looking and looking and looking out over the rooftops. Whatevers night at my place!
