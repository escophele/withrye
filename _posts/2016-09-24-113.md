The mgmt fired two people yesterday, what the hell. There hasn't been much work recently so it's not a complete surprise but it's weird because they just hired someone to start next month. So it's not really a financial issue then? But they say it's a financial issue because the client is cracking down on loose spending and we won't get real work until next quarter. So for like three whole months, we'll have to subsist on the dregs of last quarter's contracted work.

It's the powerlessness of the whole thing. They could have as easily called out my name and thanked me for my service in that stuffy conference room where no one was looking at each other.

I don't want to look for another job. I want them to fire me. I want to see what happens.
