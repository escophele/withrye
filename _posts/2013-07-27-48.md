I saw Pacific Rim the other day (very entertaining) and there was this one scene where a monster gets past the robots defending the city and it climbs out of the water onto the shore and the whole city is laid out before it in lights. And the monster makes this delighted happy noise and dives right in and thrashes around, destroying buildings and squashing things with its belly. 

I was thinking, that looks <i>so</i> much fun. If I were a giant monster, that'll be the first thing I do, I'll find a nice big city and just roll around in it.
