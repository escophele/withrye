Next time, I'm going to go on a train. Not far, like across Siberia or anything like that. Probably to Denver, or up the coast. It should at least be a few days so I can try sleeping on a bunk. I like the idea of seeing views you can't see from a car, and just being able to sit there for hours and look out a window. It's what I idealize about road trips in cars, that I could do that, but it never really turns out that way because I'll be driving, and when not, navigating. The freedom to go anywhere I want is good in theory too. From experience, I often just want to get where I'm going so I can stop driving. Pitstops are brief, when I have to pee, or really stretch my legs. And for those, I would look for some place easy to reach from the highway, like a rest stop. The idyllic nooks and offpath places I imagine I would visit on a whim never materialize; they stand no chance against getting off the road and saving time so I could finally check into that hotel bed waiting at the end of the road. That's probably the sense of adventure that people mean. That you would choose that dirt path knowing all the discomforts associated with it and still go for it. The wanty-thinky part is nothing. So, trains.
