A step is more than a step. You think you can take it back easily. It's just a step. But roads by nature pull you forward. Follow me. This way. Then they bend and you have to see. A step carries with it the next; you have already raised your back foot. So you go, and go straight, because the ground is even and you don't have to choose left or right. Turning around is now unthinkable. Go back? No. 

I need to go back!
