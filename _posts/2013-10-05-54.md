<span id="dropcap">I</span> get bad dreams. They start in my room. I'm asleep in bed that I share with my brother Timmy and a noise from the doorway wakes me up. Timmy isn't in bed next to me and I look up angry. What is he doing out of bed making a racket.

I can't see without my glasses, but in my dreams, I can see perfectly. It's the first hint I am dreaming, afterward in the morning, when I think about it.

I can see Timmy in the doorway, just standing there. I can't see his face. There is a strange glow behind him that masks him in shadow. I call out, Timmy, Timmy, but he won't answer. He seems distracted, moving his head back and forth from me to something else in the room.
