I have a bad memory because I do a lot of things by myself and so there's a lack of hooks and burrs for incidental connective tissue to catch and latch on to. Remembering things is easier the more connections there are radiating from the things than just the things themselves. It's surface area, right. I'm like an unperturbed smooth sphere rolling through, gathering no moss, forgetting and forgetting.

I didn't plan it but I have Tom Rosenthal's Go Solo on repeat as I write this. So horrible.
