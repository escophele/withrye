When I go into the bathroom at work, while standing at the urinal, I sometimes think, what if I psych myself out and can't pee and end up just standing there without making a sound. And that eventually I would have to turn around and leave the bathroom <i>without peeing</i> while the guy waiting for the urinal looks at me and knows my failure. 

It's such a relief when I finally do go.
