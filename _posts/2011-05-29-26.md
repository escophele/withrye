<span id="dropcap">I</span> fractured my collarbone earlier this month and am now about 80% healed up. It's been sucks. I still can't really lift my right arm very high or lift anything heavy. And my U-turns are more like wide slow P-turns that roam up sidewalks and driveways all over the intersection.

Bridesmaids is so much better than Hangover 2, the comparison's not even funny (neither was Hangover 2, hiyo!). The moral and take-home from both movies: weddings are HELLA stressful, exhausting, and expensive for everyone involved. Marriage, then, must surely be awesome to be worth all this.
