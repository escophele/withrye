Saturday was scattered. I went this way and that. I'm finally settled at the Starbucks on Geary with a view of the closed down Alexandria where I had snuck into to see the Matrix. A favorite memory.

I listened to some My Bloody Valentine. I really like background noise and distortion it turns out! It feels like being inside a nest in a storm.
