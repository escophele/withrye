I finally started backing up my photos and data. It's taking a long time. Spent the past few days transferring from the ancient, rickety hard drive to Google and some new drives and it's still not done. I looked through my old pictures and videos all last night and it was totally worth hoarding all these memories. They say I would never look at them again, but nope, here I am looking through years of photos and it's great. I wish I had taken even more pictures. Recorded personal history is actually precious to me.

I'm now in the folder with pictures from senior year of college. The shots of me and Chris's room made it clear how much I didn't care about decor or ideal furniture arrangement anymore. That entire house felt insubstantial. Everything felt more temporary than ever, and disposable. I don't think I felt that way when I was actually there at the time, but I don't know. I was probably terrified about finding a job to notice. But then again, I've always been sentimental, and I likely made some slow quiet bike rides in the early morning through campus looking at the places I used to hang out. If I had known how great my twenties were going to be, I wouldn't have been so saccharine lol. But yeah, nostalgia is only kicking in hard now because of how terrible my thirties are going.
