Just got bluetooth earbuds! Life-changing. I catch myself doing a habituated, reactive thing like not zipping my hoodie all the way or as fast because it would catch the wires, but then realize that there <i>are</i> no wires. The small feeling of new freedom as I slide that zipper up in one swift, complete motion is simply the best.
