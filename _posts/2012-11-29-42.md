I wanted to include this poem in my toast, but didn't, for the same reason I didn't speak without notes, because I didn't trust myself.

It's by e.e. cummings and goes like this:

since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry
&mdash;the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And death i think is no parenthesis

I am not too big on the last part when the grammar metaphors come; I guess that ties in with "syntax" in the beginning. The simple phrases really get to me though. <i>since feeling is first, my blood approves, lady I swear by all flowers. Don't cry, we are for each other:</i> Oh yes.

I first heard this on PATV, specifically <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/weddings">this episode</a>.
