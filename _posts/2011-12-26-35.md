Merry Christmas everyone. It's a few hours after the fact, yeah. It still feels very much like it. It's snowing somewhere.

I just woke up from a nap, had some soup, and am planning to stay up for a while. Winter is such a reflective season with the cold, the ending of the year and start of the next, the time off. Favorite season by far. I can see myself migrating north for the summer.

Coldplay's Christmas Lights instantly feels and sounds like a Christmas song; I don't know how they did it.

<i>Those Christmas lights, light up the street<br/>
Down where the sea and city meet<br/>
May all your troubles soon be gone<br/>
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on</i>
