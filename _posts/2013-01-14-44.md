<span id="dropcap">K</span>iss you in the wind, with everything fluttering, including you

There's just light and air everywhere around

I think we can hold on up here, and be happy

What do you think? 

Nothing down there, but normals and fear

You laugh loudly at my grand sweep of things

You say and shout, don't discount love, it doesn't live in high places where you can see everything

It's closeness

You kiss my mouth like you punched my mouth
