So picture a really big and steep waterslide, say ten miles high, ten miles long, a mile wide, that slopes super, super gradually from vertical to horizontal over those ten miles. I want to jump off a plane over the first section of that slide, within the first mile or so where it's still nearly vertical and will be for another few miles. It seems to me like I could make contact with the slide at such a steep angle that it'll just gradually take me from free fall and guide me all the way down the slide. I could just jump off planes all day long without a parachute. That'll be cool.
