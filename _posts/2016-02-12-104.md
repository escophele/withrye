Calibur on West Portal has the best fries I've had in a long time. Ever, sure. Fried in most delicious saturated beef fat tallow yes please! I think it's how I remember McDonald's fries of my youth before they changed the frying oil.

Blaze Pizza in Stonestown is so great too. It's like Subway for pizza. The spicy tomato sauce is actually spicy, and it's hard to beat adding whatever and as many toppings as you want.
