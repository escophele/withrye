Perfect weather today. Cozy.

Sundays with Grandma, versus any other day of the week, are the ones I would remember most, I think. It's just me and her. Her memory has gotten pretty bad and I've learned to just do things for her without telling her beforehand. Saves time and aggravation. I wonder what it would be like, to only remember the very recent and the very far past.
