I have a list of dailies I'm trying to chisel into habit. Write. Do push ups. Blog. And do a new thing. It's not that I have to check off everything on that list every day forever. It's impossible and not the point. Mindless consistency hasn't worked out that well for me in the past. Too brittle. The point is to set an expectation, that those are the things I will do unless something comes up. It's the minimum. Writing, push ups, etc., should be part of my background, the understood, the default, the <i>passive</i>, instead of the ad hoc thing I come upon on my calendar and actively will myself to do. They're not the special, they're the base. It's worked out ok so far for the past month or so. I think it can last.
