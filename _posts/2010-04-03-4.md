<span id="dropcap">I</span> bought a lotto ticket today, at the gas station. I began thinking of all the cool things I can do if I win. Just doing that, the fantasizing, is totally worth the $1. Like, the logistics of sorting through all my material desires and prioritizing luxuries is so much fun. What color Mini Cooper should I buy first, red or green? Delightful! And I like sorting stuff to begin with. Later, I'd forget about my ticket, and get a nice little jot of surprise once I see it in my wallet again, and remember, hey, yeah, I could be a millionaire lol. It's funny how much entertainment I can extract from this.

I'm actually stalling for time. Nothing like updating the blog while waiting all a-jitter.
