There are certain words and phrases that try to stop you from thinking. They intend to make you accept a certain meaning without further consideration, to take it as given. A friend talked about this a long while ago. I think he was talking about persuasion or the media, I don't remember.

"Terrorist" and "Nazi" and the old dependable "God works in mysterious ways," but also "freedom" and "firefighter" and "book."
