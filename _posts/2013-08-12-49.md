<span id="dropcap">I</span> stay late sometimes and the cleaning lady would start her rounds. She comes round to my cube  and empties my bin. I thank her and then, she would thank me back. This happens every time, I don't understand it. Makes me <i>not want</i> to acknowledge her so I won't have to hear her thank me for making garbage all day for her to take away.
