I've been reading a lot about early retirement and financial independence. It's so tantalizing. Retiring at 35 and spending the next 50 years doing whatever I want..that's everything right there.

It gets nuanced. I read accounts and stories from early retirees, people who made it, and what they felt like when they finally reached their final goal, and it's ultimately about happiness, right. Doing what you want makes you happy and doing things you don't want to do makes you unhappy. Yes yes, money doesn't buy happiness, this is true, but it lets you get rid of the things that make you unhappy, which makes so much sense to me.
