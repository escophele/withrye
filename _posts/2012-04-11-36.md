I'm back from Japan; it's a wonderland. Like every time I travel, it was a blur and I remember only impressions and small details. A few days here, a few days there, it was too fast for anything to really sink in. If I wanted to gain worldliness and all the coveted traits of a well-traveled person, I'd need to actually <i>be</i> there&mdash;a month, a year, <i>a while</i>&mdash;long enough to simmer with the people and get grounding of the place. Anything less, I feel I don't get to say I've really been there at all.

I <i>can</i> say I had a good time!
