<p>I finally started backing up my photos and data. It’s taking a long time. Spent the past few days transferring from my ancient, rickety hard drive to some new drives, and it’s still not done. I looked through my old pictures and videos all last night and it was totally worth hoarding all these memories. They say I would never look at them again, but nope, here I am looking through years of photos and it’s great. I wish I had taken even more pictures. Recorded personal history is actually precious to me.</p>

<p>I’m in the folder with pictures from senior year of college. The new apartment we moved into that year felt temporary and insubstantial and disposable. The shots of me and Chris’s room made it clear how little I cared about my living situation or ideal furniture arrangement at that point. I don’t think I felt that way then, when I was actually there, but I don’t know. I was probably terrified about graduation and finding a job to notice. But then again, I’ve always been sentimental. I likely made some slow, quiet bike rides in the early morning through campus, looking at the places I used to hang out. If I had known how great my twenties were going to be, I wouldn’t have been so saccharine lol. Nostalgia is only kicking in hard now because of how terrible my thirties are going.</p>
